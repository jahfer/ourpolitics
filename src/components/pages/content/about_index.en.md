Our Politics started in 2015 with a single aim: making election platforms easier to understand.

Plenty of people don't have time to read daily election news, but they still care about the policies. Our goal is to provide context to these announcements for those who don't follow politics.

Our Politics is a voluntary contribution by [@jahfer](https://mastodon.social/@jahfer), an Ottawa-based software developer.
