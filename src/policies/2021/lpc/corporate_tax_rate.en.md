The Liberals plan to increase the federal corporate income tax rate **from 15% to 18%** for financial institutions **earning over $1 billion**. The general federal corporate rate had been 22% in 2006 before a series of cuts brought it to 15% in 2010.

As part of their plan, the Liberals would also establish the “Canada recovery dividend”, which would require the companies that reach this threshold to “contribute more over the next four years of Canada's recovery.” While the details of the dividend plan have not been announced, the party estimates these efforts will raise at least **$2.5 billion/year**.
