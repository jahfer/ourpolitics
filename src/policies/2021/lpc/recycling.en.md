The Liberals plan to work with the provinces and territories to greatly reduce plastic waste—in their terms **“end plastic pollution”**—by 2030. They plan to accomplish this through a series of new efforts:

- Require all plastic packaging to be **50% recycled plastic** by 2030
- Make producers responsible for recycling plastic waste
- Products must be accepted in **80% of Canada’s recycling facilities** before being labelled as recyclable
- Enforce a recycling target of **90% for plastic beverage bottles** through deposit-return systems by 2029
