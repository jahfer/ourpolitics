The Conservatives have promised to **review the classification of guns** in the Firearms Act. This is intended to create more accurate laws that clarify the criteria used to ban a series of “assault-style weapons” in 2020. 

> "It's critically important for me to say to Canadians today that we are going to maintain the ban on assault weapons, we're going to maintain the restrictions that were put in place in 2020," [O'Toole] said.

The plan to **keep the 2020 assault-weapons ban** in place **during review** is a change from the Conservative platform:

> We will start by repealing C-71 and the May 2020 Order in Council and conducting a review of the Firearms Act with participation by law enforcement, firearms owners, manufacturers, and members of the public.
