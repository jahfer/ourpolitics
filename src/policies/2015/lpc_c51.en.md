The Liberals have promised to amend certain aspects of C-51 that they feel go too far. Mr. Trudeau is supportive of the newly-granted powers to police and spy agencies, but would support more oversight and parliamentary review.

##### What is Bill C-51?
- Enables information sharing across 17 federal agencies without judicial barriers
- Allows police to detain terrorism suspects for 7 days without charge
- Lets the Minister of Public Safety add individuals to the no-fly list
- Enables CSIS to disrupt terror plots, protests, and websites interfering with the safety or economic stability of Canada
- Prohibits speech that promotes or glorifies terrorism
