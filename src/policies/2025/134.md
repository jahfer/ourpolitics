The Bloc Québécois is committed to ensuring that Quebec's interests are directly represented in U.S. trade negotiations. They propose allowing Quebec to select its own delegation to negotiate trade agreements, emphasizing the protection of key sectors such as agriculture, aerospace, and aluminum[^1]. Additionally, they advocate for targeted counter-tariffs against U.S. tariffs, coordinated with larger economic partners, and demand parliamentary approval for preliminary trade agreement texts before ratification[^2]. The party also stresses the need to safeguard Quebec's supply management system and cultural identity during these negotiations[^3].
