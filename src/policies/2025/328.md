The Liberal Party of Canada, under the leadership of Mark Carney, has proposed replacing the consumer carbon tax with a program that incentivizes green choices. This shift aims to reduce fossil fuel consumption while strengthening regulations on methane emissions[^1]. The new approach also includes eliminating the carbon tax for consumers, small businesses, and farmers, while imposing stricter emission cuts on large corporations[^2]. These measures are part of a broader strategy to position Canada as a "clean energy superpower" by investing in green technologies and infrastructure[^3].
