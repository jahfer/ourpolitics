The Liberal Party wants to achieve free trade between provinces by Canada Day, focusing on removing federal exceptions under the Canada Free Trade Agreement. They also plan to increase mutual recognition of credentials where possible—harmonizing regulations otherwise—in industries such as health, finance, and trucking, increasing labour mobility for skilled trades. This action is expected to help increase Canada's economy by $250 billion.
