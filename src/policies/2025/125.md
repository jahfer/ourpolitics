The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is committed to eliminating all federal barriers to interprovincial trade by Canada Day 2025. This initiative aims to strengthen Canada's internal economy and reduce dependency on the United States amid trade tensions. The plan includes recalling Parliament immediately after the election to pass the necessary legislation[^1]. This policy is part of a broader strategy to enhance the movement of goods, services, and workers across provinces, which is expected to significantly boost the Canadian economy[^2].
