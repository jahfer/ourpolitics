The Bloc Québécois proposes to double federal funding for public transit over ten years, emphasizing Quebec's autonomy in selecting and managing projects[^1]. This policy aims to boost local economic returns and ensure Quebec's control over infrastructure decisions, avoiding federal partisan interference[^2]. Additionally, the Bloc advocates for the adoption of a bill mandating local procurement and economic benefits in federal contracts, similar to the U.S. Buy American Act, to maximize local economic impact[^3].
