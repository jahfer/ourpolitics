The Conservative Party has stated they would protect existing federal dental care, pharmacare, and child care programs if elected, promising that those currently receiving coverage would not lose it. While they plan to maintain these programs, they have not committed to expanding them beyond their current state.

For the childcare program, they plan to honour current $10-a-day agreements but intend to change the program to give more flexibility to parents and provinces. Specific details on future dental care coverage for groups like those aged 18-64 remain unclear.
