The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has committed to maintaining existing social assistance programs, specifically dental care and child care, without cutting them. Poilievre emphasizes protecting these programs for low-income Canadians as part of a broader strategy to appeal to diverse voter groups[^1]. Despite concerns about the continuation of these programs under a potential Conservative government, Poilievre has assured that no one currently receiving dental, pharmacare, or child-care coverage will lose it[^2]. However, the party has not committed to expanding these programs, contrasting with the Liberal-NDP supply-and-confidence agreement which planned expansions[^3].
