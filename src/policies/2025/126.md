The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney in 2025, aims to balance the federal operational budget within three years while focusing on economic growth. Carney emphasizes fiscal restraint, proposing to cap the public service size and separating operational from capital spending. His plan includes maintaining social programs like child care and dental care, while also investing in infrastructure and large-scale projects to stimulate the economy[^1][^2][^5]. Carney criticizes past spending growth and workforce increases, aiming to curb government spending growth to under 9% per decade[^3][^6].
