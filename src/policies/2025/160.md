The NDP proposes to bring back the capital gains tax changes that were planned before Prime Minister Mark Carney reversed them. They state that maintaining these changes, which tax a greater share of gains over **$250,000** for high earners, would generate an estimated **$17.4 billion** to **$19 billion** in revenue. The party argues this revenue is needed to fund public services like healthcare and pharmacare, while opposing the reversal as a giveaway that primarily benefits the wealthiest Canadians.
