The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 proposed to reinstate changes to capital gains taxes initially introduced by the Liberal government, aiming to generate $17.4 billion in revenue[^1]. The NDP criticized the decision to scrap these changes, arguing they primarily benefit the wealthiest 0.13% of Canadians, including those earning over $1.4 million annually[^2]. The party plans to use the revenue from reinstating these taxes to fund other priorities, such as raising the basic personal tax exemption and reducing the GST on essential items[^3].
