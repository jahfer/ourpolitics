The Bloc Québécois aims to abolish the position of Canada's Special Representative on Combating Islamophobia, as part of a broader effort to assert Quebec's secularism and reduce federal influence on religious and cultural matters within Quebec[^1]. This policy is part of their proposal to extend Quebec's secularism law (Bill 21) to federal employees working in Quebec, which includes prohibiting religious symbols for federal employees in positions of authority[^2]. The Bloc argues that such measures are necessary to maintain Quebec's distinct identity and ensure consistency in secular practices across federal and provincial levels[^3].
