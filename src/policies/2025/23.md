The Conservative Party of Canada aims to address the housing crisis by increasing housing incentives and reducing regulations. They propose requiring cities to boost housing construction by 15% annually, with penalties for those that fail to meet the targets and bonuses for exceeding them[^1]. Additionally, they plan to cut the GST on new homes under $1 million and sell 15% of federal buildings for affordable housing development[^2]. These measures are part of a broader strategy to enhance housing affordability and availability, particularly for young Canadians.
