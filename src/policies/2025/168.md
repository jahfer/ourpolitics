The New Democratic Party (NDP) plans to increase military spending to 2% of Canada's GDP by 2032, focusing on investments that support the Canadian Armed Forces, communities, and veterans. This policy aims to enhance Canada's defense capabilities, particularly in response to a more dangerous global environment[^1]. The NDP's approach contrasts with previous government strategies, emphasizing the importance of meeting NATO's defense spending targets while addressing the specific needs of Northerners and Arctic sovereignty[^2].
