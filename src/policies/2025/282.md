The New Democratic Party (NDP) plans to invest $16 billion in a national housing strategy to build 3 million homes by 2030. This strategy includes the Canadian Homes Transfer and the Communities First Fund, aimed at speeding up construction, protecting rentals, and lowering housing costs. The plan also focuses on stronger rent protections, faster construction using Canadian-made materials, and training 100,000 skilled workers[^1].
