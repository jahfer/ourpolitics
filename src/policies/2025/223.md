The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 is committed to strengthening gender equality rights, with a focus on increasing representation and supporting diverse communities. The NDP has nominated a candidate slate with 51% women, aiming to reflect Canada's diversity, including 32.6% racialized individuals, 20.6% 2SLGBTQIA+, 13.7% youth, 12.5% people with disabilities, and 5.8% Indigenous people[^1]. The party also supports universal access to safe, trauma-informed abortion care as a Charter Right[^2] and advocates for protections against discrimination based on gender expression[^3]. Additionally, they pledge to defend gender-affirming care and the rights of transgender, non-binary, and two-spirit individuals[^4].
