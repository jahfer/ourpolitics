The Liberal Party of Canada's 2025 policy aims to support low-income seniors by increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) by 5%, providing a tax-free annual boost of up to $652 for one year[^1]. This measure is designed to address economic uncertainties faced by retirees, particularly during market instability and the impact of global tariffs[^2]. Additionally, the policy proposes to reduce the minimum withdrawal amount from registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) by 25% for one year, offering retirees more flexibility in managing their savings during challenging economic conditions[^3].
