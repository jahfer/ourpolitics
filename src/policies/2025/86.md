The Conservative Party proposes to work with the provinces to make health and safety rules the same across Canada for tradespeople. The goal is to allow tradespeople to work anywhere in the country without needing extra or repeated training, which they say would help with labor mobility and efficiency. They also plan to include health and safety training as part of the Red Seal program.
