The Conservative Party of Canada aims to harmonize health and safety regulations to allow tradespeople to work seamlessly across the country. This policy seeks to reduce redundant retraining and improve labor mobility by creating a portable accreditation for trades workers, as part of efforts to promote the portability of certifications[^1]. Additionally, the plan includes harmonizing these regulations with provinces to enable trades workers to work anywhere in Canada, integrating health and safety training into the Red Seal program[^2].
