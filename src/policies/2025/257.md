The Conservative Party of Canada proposes to increase the basic personal amount for working seniors by $10,000, allowing them to earn up to $34,000 tax-free[^1]. This measure aims to reduce the tax burden on seniors, encouraging them to remain in the workforce[^2]. The plan also includes allowing seniors to contribute to RRSPs until age 73 and maintaining the retirement age at 65 for various benefits[^3].
