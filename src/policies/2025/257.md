This change to the tax credit would allow seniors to earn $34,000 before needing to pay income tax.

This measure aims to reduce the tax burden on seniors, encouraging them to remain in the workforce. All working seniors who earn $34,000 or more would receive an additional $1,300/year in tax refunds.
