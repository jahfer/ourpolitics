The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 proposed eliminating public subsidies and tax breaks for oil and gas companies, aiming to redirect the saved $18 billion over ten years into a major home retrofit program[^1]. This initiative is designed to address the climate crisis, reduce energy costs for families, and create jobs in retrofit and manufacturing sectors[^2]. Additionally, the NDP's plan emphasizes the need to counter economic impacts from external factors such as Trump's trade war[^3].
