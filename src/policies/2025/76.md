The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney in 2025, maintains a policy focused on keeping industrial carbon pricing and emissions caps in place as part of their environmental strategy. This approach aims to balance environmental goals with economic considerations, ensuring industries remain competitive while addressing climate change. The party emphasizes the importance of reducing emissions through a structured pricing system for large industrial emitters, contrasting with the Conservative Party's plan to dismantle the carbon pricing regime[^1].

The Liberals argue that maintaining the emissions cap, specifically for the oil and gas sector, is crucial for reducing emissions by about one-third over the next eight years. This policy is part of broader efforts to make Canada a leader in both conventional and green energy, despite industry concerns that the targets could lead to reduced investment and employment in the sector[^2].
