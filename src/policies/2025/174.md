The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is focused on negotiating a new economic and security agreement with the United States, particularly in response to U.S. tariffs affecting Canada[^1]. Carney has emphasized the importance of preparing for these negotiations, which are scheduled to begin in early May 2025, to ensure Canada is well-positioned regardless of the election outcome[^2]. Additionally, the Liberals are diversifying trade relationships beyond the U.S., targeting partners in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and like-minded countries in Asia to mitigate the impact of U.S. trade tensions[^3].
