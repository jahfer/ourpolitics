The Bloc Québécois aims to recruit American researchers in cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum sciences, biomedicine, and clean energy, in response to funding cuts in the U.S. They propose investing in facilities and laboratories to attract these scientists[^1]. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to position Quebec as a haven for scientific talent, supporting regional universities by reinvesting in research, rebalancing funding, and ensuring predictable funding envelopes[^1]. The urgency is highlighted by the European Union's efforts to attract U.S. scientific talent[^1].
