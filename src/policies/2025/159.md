The NDP proposes to raise the Guaranteed Income Supplement with the goal of lifting all seniors out of poverty. This policy, combined with doubling the Canada Disability Benefit, is estimated to cost between **$3 billion and $4 billion** each year. These initiatives are part of the party's overall **$19 billion** annual tax policy plan aimed at supporting working and middle-class families.
