The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 has proposed to increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) as a measure to lift all seniors out of poverty. This initiative is part of a broader plan to enhance financial support for vulnerable groups, including seniors and individuals with disabilities, aiming to improve their standard of living and address income disparities. The cost of these measures, which also include doubling the Canada Disability Benefit, is estimated at $3 billion to $4 billion annually[^1].
