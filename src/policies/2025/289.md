The Conservative Party of Canada's policy to pre-approve building permits for high-density housing around transit stations aims to integrate housing development with transit infrastructure. This measure ensures that transit projects are accompanied by increased housing supply, with federal transit funding contingent on municipalities demonstrating progress in housing construction. The policy is part of a broader strategy to address rising housing costs by incentivizing municipalities to accelerate housing development[^1].
