The New Democratic Party (NDP) is focused on expanding pharmacare, dental care, and mental health supports to ensure comprehensive healthcare for all Canadians. They emphasize the importance of pharmacare, aiming to provide free diabetes, birth control, and menopause medications, which could save families up to $2,000 annually[^1]. Additionally, the NDP has successfully pressured the Liberals to implement national dental care and pharmacare programs, highlighting their role in enhancing healthcare accessibility for working-class Canadians[^2]. Their commitment includes training more doctors from northern and rural communities to address healthcare disparities[^3].
