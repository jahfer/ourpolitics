The Conservative Party of Canada plans to invest $1 billion to fund addiction treatment for approximately 50,000 Canadians, focusing on a results-based approach for treatment centers. This funding aims to address the opioid crisis, which has claimed 50,000 lives since 2016[^1]. Critics argue that the abstinence-based model could increase overdose risks if individuals relapse, highlighting concerns over the policy's potential impact[^2]. The party also intends to redirect resources from supervised consumption sites to support these treatment initiatives[^3].
