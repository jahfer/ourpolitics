The Conservative Party proposes to invest **$1 billion** to help about **50,000 Canadians** access addiction treatment and recovery programs. This funding would support things like detox centers, counselling, job training, and transitional housing.

Their plan involves shifting away from harm reduction by ending federal funding for supervised consumption sites and safe supply programs and imposing strict rules or closure on existing sites, particularly those near schools or parks. This policy is presented as a way to get people off drugs and tackle the overdose crisis that has led to the deaths of many Canadians, including **50,000** since 2016.
