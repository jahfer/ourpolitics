The Conservative Party plans to scrap the Liberal government's gun buyback program. They would redirect the estimated $600 million allocated for the program to enhance border security. The party argues this funding should be focused on preventing illegal firearms from entering Canada to address gun violence. They have also pledged to undo the Liberals' handgun ban.
