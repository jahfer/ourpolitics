The Liberal Party of Canada, under Liberal Leader Mark Carney, has committed to capping immigration levels temporarily until housing infrastructure expands. This policy aims to align immigration with available housing capacity, addressing concerns about the impact of immigration on housing and social services[^1]. Carney has emphasized working with provincial governments to build capacity, a response to public concerns about the strain on housing and healthcare systems[^2]. The policy includes maintaining caps on international students and temporary foreign workers until the housing market can accommodate increased immigration levels[^3].
