The Liberals plan to cap the current immigration levels across multiple categories. Temporary workers and international students will be limited to less than 5% of the population by the end of 2027. As well, permanent residents will be capped at less than 1% in the same time frame.

In a bid to boost French-language speakers in the country, the party is also aiming to boost the current targets for Francophone immigrants by 20%, to 12% of total immigration outside of Quebec.
