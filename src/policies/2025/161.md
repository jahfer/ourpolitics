The Green Party of Canada proposes raising the basic personal tax exemption amount to $40,000. This plan is intended to provide a tax break of up to $3,675 for 78% of taxpayers earning less than $100,000. The party estimates this policy would cost **$47 billion** and intends to fund it by increasing corporate taxes and cutting corporate subsidies.
