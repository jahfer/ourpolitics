The New Democratic Party (NDP) is committed to ensuring that Indigenous Treaty rights, Charter rights, French language, labour protections, and environmental safeguards are not compromised in trade negotiations. This stance is part of a broader effort to protect fundamental rights and uphold environmental standards in trade agreements, with a specific focus on Indigenous and linguistic rights[^1]. Additionally, the NDP criticizes leaders like Mark Carney for not adequately addressing Indigenous rights, citing legal disputes involving Indigenous communities as evidence of neglect[^2][^3].
