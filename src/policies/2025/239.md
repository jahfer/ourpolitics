The Conservative Party of Canada emphasizes the importance of enforcing laws against illegal elver poaching to protect the eel population, ensure the sustainability of the fishery, and maintain environmental health. The party criticizes the Liberal Party's handling of the issue, highlighting increased poaching activities, threats to resident safety, and inadequate law enforcement responses. The Conservatives call for accountability and effective enforcement to restore order and support conservation efforts[^1].
