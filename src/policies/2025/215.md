The New Democratic Party (NDP) plans to build an East-West clean energy grid using Canadian products to enhance energy security and create jobs in the green sector. This initiative aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and promote environmental sustainability by generating thousands of jobs in the green energy sector[^1]. The grid is part of a broader strategy to protect Canadian workers from international trade disputes and support domestic energy resilience[^2].
