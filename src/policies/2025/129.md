The Conservative Party of Canada aims to reduce regulation by 25% and eliminate the federal deficit through spending cuts, with a goal to balance the budget within five years[^1]. Their plan includes cutting government spending by reducing funds to initiatives such as the housing infrastructure fund, housing accelerator fund, and foreign aid, while also decreasing the size of the public service[^2]. Additionally, they propose a $14 billion annual tax cut by lowering the lowest income-tax rate from 15% to 12.75% by 2027-28, funded by eliminating government waste and reducing spending on consultants[^3].
