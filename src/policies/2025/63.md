To protect Canadian industries, the NDP plans to change the Investment Canada Act so foreign takeovers must clearly benefit Canada's economy and jobs, be more open, and include unions in reviews. They aim to stop foreign companies from taking valuable assets from Canadian plants, especially after they've received public money, and will work to protect important Canadian industries like critical minerals from being sold off. The party also wants to use government spending rules to buy Canadian goods and build Canadian infrastructure.
