The New Democratic Party (NDP) aims to protect Canadian industries from foreign takeovers by amending the Investment Canada Act to apply 'net benefit' criteria to economic and employment factors, increasing transparency, and including unions in the review process[^1]. This policy is part of their broader "Workers for Canada" plan, which focuses on safeguarding Canadian jobs and industries from external economic pressures[^2]. The NDP also promises to prevent asset stripping in Canadian plants by companies that received public funding, ensuring taxpayer funds benefit Canadian workers and industries[^3].
