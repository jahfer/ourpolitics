The Liberal Party plans to establish 10 new national parks and marine conservation areas, as well as 15 new urban parks. To make these places more accessible, the policy includes making national parks and historical sites free to visit during the summer.

For June–August 2025, the Liberals also plan to introduce a “Canada Strong Pass”, providing children and youth under 18 with free access to national galleries and museums, as well as free VIA Rail train ticketes when they travel with their parents.
