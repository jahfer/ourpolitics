The Liberal Party of Canada plans to create 10 new national parks and marine conservation areas, with an emphasis on enhancing conservation efforts and promoting accessibility to natural and historical sites. As part of this initiative, they propose making national parks and historical sites free to visit during the summer, aiming to attract voters in regions like British Columbia. The policy is part of a broader effort to enhance conservation and biodiversity, with a focus on environmental sovereignty concerns[^1][^2][^3].
