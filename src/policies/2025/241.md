The Bloc Québécois is advocating for increased parliamentary oversight in international trade agreements. They propose that the federal government should obtain parliamentary approval for the preliminary texts of any free trade agreements before ratification[^1]. This policy is part of a broader effort to ensure Quebec's interests are directly represented in trade negotiations, particularly in response to concerns over agreements like the USMCA (ACEUM) and ongoing trade tensions with the United States[^2]. The Bloc aims to address issues such as breaches in supply management and the unfair treatment of Quebec's aluminum industry, while also protecting Quebec's linguistic identity and jurisdictional autonomy[^3].
