The New Democratic Party (NDP) supports the high-speed rail project connecting Toronto to Qu√©bec City, emphasizing that it should be developed publicly rather than privatized. They argue that public management would ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness, while also prioritizing the use of Canadian steel and aluminum to support domestic industries[^1][^2]. The NDP criticizes the Liberal government's approach, suggesting that privatization could lead to increased costs and delays[^3].
