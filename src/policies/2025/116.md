The Liberal Party of Canada plans to expand dental care coverage to low-income adults aged 18-64, starting applications in May 2025 with coverage beginning as early as June 1, 2025. This expansion is part of a phased rollout, initially covering children, seniors, and residents with valid disability tax credits, aiming to provide preventative dental care and reduce emergency dental visits[^1]. The program is designed to help approximately 1.7 million Canadians already receiving care and an additional 4.5 million expected to be eligible, addressing affordability issues as 32% of young adults aged 18 to 34 had avoided dental visits due to cost in 2023/2024[^2].
