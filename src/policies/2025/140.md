The Bloc Québécois aims to boost the Canadian economy by prioritizing local suppliers and wood in federal contracts. This policy includes proposing a federal charter to maximize the use of Canadian wood in construction, a response to U.S. tariffs on Canadian lumber[^1]. Additionally, they seek to guarantee local procurement and reserve a percentage of Canadian content in federal contracts, inspired by the Buy American Act, with a 25% advantage in tenders for Quebec and Canadian companies[^2]. These initiatives are designed to support local industries, including forestry and construction, in the face of U.S. trade challenges.
