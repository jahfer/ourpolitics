The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 proposed building an East-West clean energy grid using Canadian products, aimed at delivering affordable and secure energy while creating thousands of green jobs. This initiative is part of their broader "Workers for Canada" plan, designed to keep Canadian workers employed during trade disputes with the United States and reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. The plan includes retrofitting homes with energy-saving upgrades, supporting Canadian-made solutions, and investing in northern infrastructure to enhance energy security and telecommunications[^1].
