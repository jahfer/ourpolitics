The New Democratic Party (NDP) is committed to establishing a Canadian rapid-reaction United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force to address emerging conflicts and fulfill Canada's international commitments. This initiative includes forming a 500-member Quick Reaction Force ready for deployment in UN peacekeeping missions, as part of a broader strategy to restore Canada's peacekeeping role[^1]. The NDP has criticized Canada's withdrawal from the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, citing concerns about civilian safety and a decline in Canada's peacekeeping presence[^2].
