The Liberal Party of Canada's 2025 tax policy proposes to reduce the lowest income-tax rate from 15% to 14%, aiming to provide financial relief to Canadians and stimulate the economy[^1]. This tax cut is estimated to cost $6 billion annually and is part of a broader strategy to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs and support middle- and low-income families[^2]. The policy is expected to benefit over 22 million Canadians, with savings up to $825 annually for two-income households[^3].
