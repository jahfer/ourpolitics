The Liberal Party of Canada has awarded contracts to Canadian shipyards for the construction of two polar icebreakers as part of the National Shipbuilding Strategy. This initiative involves a $3.25 billion contract to Davie Shipbuilding in LÃ©vis, Quebec, and a $3.15 billion contract to Seaspan's Vancouver Shipyards, with completion expected by 2030[^1]. These contracts are aimed at renewing the Coast Guard and Navy fleets while supporting domestic shipbuilding industries[^2]. The government is committed to fulfilling all planned orders, which includes the construction of Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ships and River Class Destroyers, supporting 21,400 jobs across the country[^3].
