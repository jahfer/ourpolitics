The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes a permanent ban on foreign homebuyers to address housing affordability in Canada. This policy aims to prevent speculation and keep homes in the hands of Canadians who live and work in the country, by closing loopholes for numbered companies and corporate proxies[^1]. As part of a broader strategy, the NDP also plans to invest in affordable housing and implement stronger rent protections to combat the housing crisis[^2]. The policy contrasts with other parties' approaches, which have been criticized for attracting foreign capital into the housing market[^3].
