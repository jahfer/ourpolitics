The Conservative Party of Canada is focused on supporting Indigenous-led resource projects through loan guarantees. They plan to establish the Canadian Indigenous Opportunities Corporation (CIOC) to provide these guarantees, aiming to empower Indigenous communities economically and foster self-determination[^1]. Additionally, the Conservatives support a "First Nations resource charge," allowing First Nations to opt-in to directly tax resource development projects on their lands, which has been endorsed by the bi-partisan First Nations Tax Commission[^2]. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to involve First Nations in resource projects, ensuring economic benefits directly flow to Indigenous communities[^3].
