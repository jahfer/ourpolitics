The Liberal Party of Canada, under Mark Carney's leadership, aims to streamline major project approvals by eliminating redundant federal duplication of provincial environmental assessments.

Carney's approach includes establishing a Major Federal Project Office to consolidate reviews and issue decisions within two years instead of the current five[^2].
