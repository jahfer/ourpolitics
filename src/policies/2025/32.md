The Liberal Party of Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, has established a new ministerial portfolio titled "Canadian Culture and Identity," led by Steven Guilbeault, who moved from the environment portfolio to this new role[^1]. This move reflects a broader cabinet restructuring aimed at emphasizing Canadian cultural identity, even as several social policy-focused portfolios were eliminated[^2]. The creation of this ministry underscores the Liberal government's commitment to reinforcing Canadian culture, especially amid tensions with the United States and the need to protect Canadian sovereignty[^3].
