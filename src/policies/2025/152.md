The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes that U.S. automakers must use Canadian-made parts or assemble vehicles in Canada to access the Canadian market. This policy aims to ensure American companies contribute to the Canadian economy and workforce, especially in response to U.S. tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles[^1]. Additionally, the NDP plans to redirect revenue from counter tariffs on U.S. imports to support affected Canadian workers and communities, reinforcing their commitment to protect domestic industries[^2]. The party also suggests removing GST from Canadian-made vehicles and prioritizing these for federal government use to further bolster local manufacturing[^3].
