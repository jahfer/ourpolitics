The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes measures to prevent U.S. corporations from stripping assets from Canadian auto plants after receiving government subsidies. This policy includes legally prohibiting asset stripping and ensuring that companies benefiting from public funds do not remove equipment, thereby protecting Canadian investments[^1]. The NDP emphasizes safeguarding taxpayer-funded assets in the auto sector, which has received over $30 billion in public funds over the past five years[^2].
