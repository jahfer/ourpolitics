The Conservative Party supports bringing back the seal harvest, stating it is needed to manage seal and sea lion populations, protect fish stocks, and preserve jobs in the fishing industry. They also say restoring the harvest will help keep jobs in the fishing industry, particularly for Indigenous and local communities, and restore a traditional way of life in places like Newfoundland.
