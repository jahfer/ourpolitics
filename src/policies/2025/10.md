The Bloc Québécois supports implementing legislative safeguards recommended by the Hogue Commission to protect against foreign interference and restore public trust in government institutions. Bloc leader Yves-François Blanchet emphasized the importance of these measures following the Commission of Inquiry into Foreign Interference, chaired by Judge Marie-Josée Hogue[^1]. Additionally, the Bloc Québécois suggests examining the restoration of public funding for political parties as part of these efforts[^2].
