The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 plans to raise the basic personal tax exemption to $19,500 for most Canadians. This policy aims to provide tax relief to low- and middle-income earners, saving individuals up to $505 annually, while reducing the exemption to $13,500 for those earning $253,414 or more[^1]. The estimated cost of this measure is $10.4 billion annually, which the NDP intends to fund by closing corporate tax loopholes and maintaining the capital gains tax increase[^2]. As part of a broader strategy, the NDP also proposes eliminating the GST on essential items and increasing benefits for seniors and individuals with disabilities, with the total cost of all measures estimated at $19 billion annually[^3].
