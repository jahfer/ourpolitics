The NDP wants to raise the amount of income people can earn before paying federal taxes to $19,500. This plan would save individuals who make between $19,500 and $177,882 up to $505 each year. For people earning over $177,882, the tax-free amount would slowly go down, reaching $13,500 for those making $253,414 or more.

This tax change alone is expected to cost **$10.4 billion annually**, and the party plans to pay for it by making big companies pay their fair share and keeping the tax on large investment profits.
