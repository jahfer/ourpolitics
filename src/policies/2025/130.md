The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, plans to implement tax cuts on work, investment, energy, and homebuilding to stimulate economic growth and empower Canadians financially[^1]. This policy includes a "Bring It Home Tax Cut," which aims to reduce taxes on work, investment, energy, and homebuilding to make Canada more economically self-reliant and counteract the impact of U.S. tariffs[^2]. The party proposes a significant reduction in the lowest personal income tax bracket from 15% to 12.75%, saving the average worker approximately $900 annually, at an estimated cost of $14 billion per year by 2027-28[^3].
