The Conservative Party plans to implement a "Bring It Home Tax Cut" aimed at reducing taxes on work, investment, energy, and homebuilding to increase Canadians' take-home pay and stimulate the economy.

As part of this plan, they propose **reducing the lowest personal income tax bracket from 15% to 12.75%**, which they estimate would save the average worker about $900 annually, **costing the government $14 billion/year** when fully in place in 2027. They state this would be funded by cutting government spending on things like bureaucracy and consultants.
