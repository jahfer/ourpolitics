The Bloc Québécois demands Quebec's direct participation in USMCA negotiations, emphasizing the need for Quebec-chosen representatives. This stance reflects concerns over economic vulnerabilities, such as tariffs on aluminum and softwood lumber, and aims to ensure Quebec's interests are protected in trade discussions with the United States. Yves-François Blanchet has highlighted the importance of defending Quebec's linguistic identity and industries, advocating for proportional counter-tariffs and greater involvement in negotiations[^1][^2][^3].
