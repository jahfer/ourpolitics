The Conservative Party is proposing a "three strikes" law, which would mean that individuals convicted of three serious offenses would receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and potentially up to life. This policy aims to deny bail, probation, parole, or house arrest for these repeat offenders, and their release would be dependent on showing good behaviour, passing drug tests, and getting education or training while in jail.

The party also supports tougher sentencing for serious crimes like drug, human, and gun trafficking, suggesting mandatory life sentences for these offenders. Additionally, they plan to reintroduce a law allowing judges to combine parole waiting periods for people convicted of multiple murders.
