The Conservative Party's 2025 policy aims to tackle repeat offenders and serious crimes with stricter measures. It proposes a **"three strikes" law**, mandating a minimum 10-year sentence for individuals convicted of three serious offenses[^1]. This policy also includes denying bail to repeat offenders and imposing mandatory life sentences for specific crimes like fentanyl trafficking, human trafficking, and gun smuggling[^2]. Critics argue that such mandatory minimum sentences may be unconstitutional and could undermine the judicial system[^3].
