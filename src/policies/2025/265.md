The Bloc Québécois proposes modernizing Radio-Canada/CBC by strengthening the independence between its English and French services, especially for advertising money, and making all online content free and easy to find. They also aim to increase funding for cultural programs like the Arts Council and Téléfilm Canada, making sure **40%** of this money goes to French-language content.

Other plans include creating a Quebec CRTC or requiring Ottawa to get Quebec's approval on broadcasting rules, and giving tax breaks for productions that use Quebecois, Francophone, or Indigenous songs. The party also wants to bring all powers over culture back to Quebec and support finding Quebecois works online.
