The Bloc Québécois aims to modernize Radio-Canada/CBC by enhancing its independence, especially in terms of revenue and advertising, and ensuring the accessibility of all online content[^1]. They propose to allocate 40% of funding to francophone content through programs like the Conseil des arts and Téléfilm Canada[^2]. Additionally, they seek to create a Quebec-specific CRTC and require Ottawa to consult Quebec and Francophone communities before any broadcasting regulations[^3].
