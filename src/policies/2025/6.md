The Bloc Québécois is committed to defending Quebec's supply management system in agricultural trade agreements, particularly in negotiations with the United States. They aim to prevent further concessions in supply management that have been made in previous agreements like USMCA, CETA, and CPTPP. To ensure the protection of this system, the Bloc plans to reintroduce and pass Bill C-282 before summer 2025, potentially using closure to expedite its passage[^1].
