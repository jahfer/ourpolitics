The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes to extend the anti-flipping tax from 1 year to 5 years, targeting speculative property flipping by taxing profits from residential properties sold within this period as income unless they are principal residences[^1]. This measure aims to curb the rapid increase in housing prices driven by speculation, ensuring that profits from quick sales contribute fairly to taxation[^2]. The NDP's approach contrasts with the Liberal Party's policies, which have been criticized for attracting foreign capital into the housing market, and the Conservative Party's focus on tax breaks for speculators[^3]. The policy is part of a broader NDP strategy to address housing affordability, including significant investments in affordable housing and stronger rent controls[^4].
