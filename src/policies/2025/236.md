The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes introducing "Victory Bonds" to fund public infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and transit systems, to strengthen the Canadian economy amid trade tensions with the U.S. The bonds would be available in 5- and 10-year terms, offering a 3.5% compounding interest rate, 0.25% higher than average five-year GICs, with interest being tax-free if held to maturity. Administrative costs for the program are estimated at $75-80 million[^1].
