The NDP plans to sell special bonds to Canadians, similar to wartime bonds, which would be available for 5 or 10 years and could be bought through payroll deduction. These bonds would pay a 3.5% compounding interest rate, which is 0.25% higher than average 5-year bank GICs. The money collected would be used only for building public infrastructure like roads, bridges, housing, and transit, and not for general government spending. The estimated cost to run this program is estimated around $80 million.
