The Bloc Québécois aims to establish guidelines for public prayer in federal spaces, ensuring respect for individual rights and public order. This initiative follows incidents at Montréal-Trudeau Airport and the Ottawa train station, where public prayer practices led to disputes. The Bloc emphasizes the need for clear guidelines to prevent favoritism and ensure all faiths can practice in federal public spaces without disruption[^1].
