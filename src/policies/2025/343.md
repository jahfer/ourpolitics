The Bloc Québécois proposes studying and setting guidelines for public prayer in federal places like airports and train stations, following issues at the Montréal-Trudeau Airport and Ottawa train station where prayer led to problems and unclear staff responses. The aim is to create rules so people of all faiths can practice discreetly in federal public spaces without disruption, ensuring fair application of regulations and avoiding favouritism or pressure on others.
