The Liberal Party of Canada has committed to continuing funding for Jordanâ€™s Principle through 2026, ensuring that First Nations children have equal access to government-funded services. This commitment addresses service gaps for Indigenous children, as highlighted by Minister of Indigenous Services Patty Hajdu[^1]. Additionally, the Liberals have announced a $253 million funding package for Indigenous reconciliation initiatives in the North, focusing on upgrading power plants and improving housing infrastructure in Nunavut[^2]. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to advance Indigenous reconciliation and support economic opportunities for Indigenous communities.
