The Liberal Party of Canada aims to enhance the ability to intercept illegal substances and contraband moving through the mail by amending the Canada Post Corporation Act to allow warrant-backed search-and-seizure operations. This initiative is part of a broader effort to strengthen border security and reduce the flow of illicit goods, particularly targeting organized crime and drug trafficking[^1]. Additionally, the Liberals plan to train 1,000 new Canada Border Services Agency officers to combat illegal guns, drugs like fentanyl, and smuggled cars at the border, further bolstering their strategy to ensure public safety[^2].
