The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has proposed reducing annual immigration levels to align with housing availability, targeting a cap that ensures new immigrants do not exceed the number of homes built in the previous year. This policy aims to address the housing crisis by linking immigration to economic capacity, such as jobs, homes, and healthcare availability[^1]. Additionally, Poilievre has criticized the current immigration levels for contributing to the housing shortage and has proposed returning to Harper-era immigration levels[^2].
