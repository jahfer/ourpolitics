The Conservative Party of Canada has proposed a business-liquidity support program in response to U.S. tariffs, aiming to provide temporary loans to businesses directly affected to keep workers employed[^1]. This program is part of a broader strategy that includes retaliatory tariffs on non-essential U.S. goods and services and income replacement for affected workers and businesses[^2]. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre emphasized the importance of mitigating the economic impact of U.S. tariffs by implementing these support measures[^3].
