The Conservative Party of Canada plans to create a special class of rapid Employment Insurance (EI) payouts for skilled tradespeople by allowing union training centers and colleges to pre-register apprentices for EI. This initiative aims to streamline access to EI benefits for trades workers, ensuring they receive support quickly during training or transitions[^1]. Additionally, the policy includes restoring apprenticeship grants up to $4,000 and expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP) to support apprenticeship training facilities[^2]. These measures are part of a broader strategy to boost training and employment in the skilled trades, with the goal of reducing reliance on the U.S. economy and addressing the affordability of homes built by tradespeople[^3].
