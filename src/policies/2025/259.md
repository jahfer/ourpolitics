The Conservative Party of Canada plans to streamline resource project approvals by repealing Bill C-69 (the Impact Assessment Act) within 60 days of taking office[^1]. They aim to replace it with a law that expedites project approvals within a year, as part of their strategy to "unleash production of our resources" and strengthen the economy[^1]. This policy includes creating a 'Rapid Resource Project Office' for a single environmental review process[^2], and establishing a 'National Energy Corridor' for pre-approved infrastructure transport[^3]. The party emphasizes reducing bureaucratic delays and enhancing economic growth while maintaining environmental standards.
