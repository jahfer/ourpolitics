The Bloc Québécois advocates for targeted counter-tariffs against the U.S. to protect Quebec's vulnerable sectors such as agriculture and aluminum, emphasizing coordination with larger economic partners[^1]. The party demands Quebec's direct participation in Canadian delegations negotiating with the U.S., ensuring that Quebec's interests are represented[^2]. Yves-François Blanchet, the Bloc leader, stresses the need for a common strategy among trading partners to safeguard Quebec's industries and proposes a loan program to provide transitional liquidity for affected businesses[^3].
