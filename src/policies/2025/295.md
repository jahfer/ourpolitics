The New Democratic Party (NDP) is committed to implementing universal pharmacare within four years, prioritizing coverage for approximately 100 essential medications, including diabetes medication and contraception[^1].

The NDP highlights the importance of pharmacare in ensuring all Canadians can access necessary medications, with an estimated annual cost of $3.5 billion[^3].
