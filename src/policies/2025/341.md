The Conservative Party plans to shift from harm reduction, like supervised consumption sites, towards addiction treatment and recovery. They propose ending federal funding for supervised consumption sites and safe supply programs and stopping the exemption for overdose prevention sites in September 2025. Existing supervised consumption sites would face stricter federal standards, like requiring users to show a health card, and if they don't comply within a year, they would be shut down.
