The Conservative Party of Canada's policy in 2025 focuses on restricting supervised consumption sites and closing overdose prevention sites. They propose banning these sites within 500 meters of schools, daycares, parks, and seniors' homes, and shutting down existing sites that do not comply with federal standards within a year[^1]. Additionally, they plan to end the exemption for overdose prevention sites under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act by September 30, 2025[^2]. This policy aims to address the opioid crisis by reallocating funds towards addiction recovery programs, with a $1 billion investment intended to support approximately 50,000 Canadians[^3].
