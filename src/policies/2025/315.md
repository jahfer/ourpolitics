To help make housing more affordable, the Conservatives want cities to cut development taxes on new homes. The federal government would then match these tax cuts, up to $25,000 per home, potentially saving homebuyers up to $50,000. This measure is part of a larger plan that includes actions like speeding up building permits and making more land available for construction.
