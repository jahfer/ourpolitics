The Conservative Party of Canada proposes to cut municipal development taxes on new home construction, offering a federal government match of up to $25,000 per home, for a potential maximum savings of $50,000. This initiative is part of a broader housing strategy to make homes more affordable by reducing taxes on new construction, which the Conservatives estimate will cost $1.56 billion annually[^1]. The policy aims to incentivize municipalities to expedite housing development, thereby addressing the rising costs of housing and supporting more Canadians in achieving homeownership[^2].
