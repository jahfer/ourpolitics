The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 is committed to investing in Canadian journalism and strengthening CBC/Radio-Canada. They propose banning executive bonuses at CBC and support local public broadcasting to ensure a reliable and independent media landscape[^1]. The NDP criticizes the Liberals for delaying necessary reforms and the Conservatives for threatening to defund CBC, emphasizing the importance of a robust public broadcaster in preserving Canadian culture and sovereignty[^2].
