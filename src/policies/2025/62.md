The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 emphasizes strengthening Canada's economy by prioritizing procurement rules to support Canadian industries and workers, ensuring government spending benefits domestic production and employment[^1]. Additionally, the NDP advocates for incentivizing value-added processing in Canada, such as refining raw materials domestically, to reduce reliance on exports and create local jobs[^2]. This strategy is part of their broader plan to build a more self-reliant economy and protect Canadian workers from the impacts of international trade challenges.
