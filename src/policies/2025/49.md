The Liberal Party of Canada aims to develop a national trade and energy corridor to enhance the movement of energy, critical minerals, and digital connectivity across the country. This initiative seeks to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers and improve infrastructure efficiency, as agreed upon by Prime Minister Mark Carney and provincial premiers[^1]. Additionally, the plan includes establishing a "First Mile Fund" to support infrastructure linking resource extraction sites to transportation networks, aiming to diversify Canada's trade relationships and reduce reliance on the United States[^2].
