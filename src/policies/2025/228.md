The Conservative Party of Canada plans to create a "National Energy Corridor" to expedite the approval and construction of critical infrastructure projects, such as pipelines, transmission lines, and railways, across Canada[^1]. This initiative aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. market and attract billions in investment, creating jobs and restoring economic independence[^2]. The policy includes legally binding commitments from all levels of government and involves First Nations from the outset to ensure economic benefits and secure their approval[^3].
