The Bloc Québécois has proposed the creation of a Ministry of Borders to address what they perceive as significant issues in Canada's border security, including irregular crossings, arms trafficking, and pandemic mismanagement[^1]. This ministry would integrate the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and coordinate border-related efforts across all ministries, aiming to enhance security and efficiency at border points[^2]. The party also advocates for increased staffing for the CBSA and RCMP, and reversing reductions in border crossing operating hours to ensure better coverage and accessibility[^3].
