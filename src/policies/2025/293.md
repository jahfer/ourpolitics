The Bloc Québécois aims to exclude Quebec from Canada's Multiculturalism Act, allowing the province to establish its own integration model for newcomers[^1]. This move is part of a broader effort to reinforce Quebec's autonomy in shaping its immigration policies, reflecting its unique cultural and historical context[^2]. Additionally, the Bloc mandates that immigrants in Quebec demonstrate sufficient knowledge of French to obtain Canadian citizenship, replacing the current requirement of English or French[^3]. This policy aligns with Quebec's reality as a predominantly French-speaking province and emphasizes the importance of French for successful integration[^4].
