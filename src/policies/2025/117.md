The Liberal Party of Canada has committed to providing over $1.1 billion in additional funding for transit projects in Montreal and Quebec City. This includes $650 million for extending Montreal's Metro, which will feature five new stations spanning six kilometers and is expected to be operational by 2031[^1]. Additionally, $202.8 million will be invested to update Montreal's subway train control system, and $332.3 million will be allocated to Quebec City's 19-kilometer tramway project, which will service 29 stations[^2]. These initiatives are part of a larger effort to spur economic development, improve mobility, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
