The Bloc Québécois is advocating for an immediate and equitable distribution of asylum seekers across Canadian provinces, focusing on demographic weight to ensure fair allocation[^1]. This policy is in response to Quebec's overwhelmed capacity to host asylum seekers, exacerbated by delays in processing claims, which have extended up to 47 months as of February 2025[^2]. The party also emphasizes the need for adequate financial resources and incentives to ensure dignified reception and provincial collaboration[^3].
