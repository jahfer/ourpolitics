The Conservative Party proposes changing the Conflict of Interest Act to require party leadership candidates to disclose their financial holdings within 30 days and make them public within 60 days. They also want future prime ministers and cabinet ministers to sell off assets that cause conflicts of interest within 30 days of taking office. Additionally, they plan to strengthen the Accountability Act to prevent politicians from making decisions that mostly benefit themselves or their families and increase fines for ethics violations up to $10,000.
