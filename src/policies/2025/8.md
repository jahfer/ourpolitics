The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, proposed reforms to the Conflict of Interest Act in 2025, targeting what they call the "Carney loophole." The reforms aim to require party leadership candidates to disclose their financial holdings within 30 days of candidacy and make them public within 60 days. Additionally, future prime ministers and cabinet ministers would be required to sell assets that create conflicts of interest within 30 days of assuming office[^1].
