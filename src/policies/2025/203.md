The Bloc Québécois supports Quebec's Bill 96, emphasizing the importance of French language protection in Quebec. They advocate for Quebec to be the sole authority over its linguistic policy, exempting it from the application of the Official Languages Act and ensuring that the French Language Charter applies to federally regulated businesses[^1]. The Bloc also proposes repatriating Quebec's share of funding from the Official Languages Action Plan to strengthen French within the province[^2]. They argue that these measures are necessary to counteract the threat to French in Quebec and Canada, and to promote French as the primary language in federal workplaces and among senior officials in Quebec[^3].
