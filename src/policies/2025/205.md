The Bloc Québécois is proposing measures to strengthen regional universities in Quebec by addressing funding imbalances and supporting smaller institutions. They aim to rebalance research funding, which currently sees 15 Canadian universities, 12 of which are outside Quebec, receiving 80% of the funds[^1]. The proposal includes more predictable funding envelopes and support for French-language research and publications, ensuring regional universities can compete for talent and resources[^2]. Additionally, they plan to collaborate with Quebec to manage international student intake, ensuring it aligns with the needs of regional universities[^3].
