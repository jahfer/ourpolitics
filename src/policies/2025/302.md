The Liberal Party of Canada, under the leadership of Mark Carney, has pledged to repeal the entire consumer carbon price. This policy aims to alleviate the financial burden on consumers by eliminating the carbon levy on home heating fuel and other consumer goods, as criticized by Mark Carney[^1]. The move is part of a broader strategy to maintain the carbon price on industrial emitters to meet emissions reduction targets[^2]. The decision reflects a shift in the Liberal Party's approach to climate policy, focusing on economic competitiveness and addressing voter concerns about affordability[^3].
