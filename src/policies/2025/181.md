The Bloc Québécois has proposed a 10% increase in the Old Age Security pension specifically for individuals aged 65 to 74. This policy aims to address age-based discrimination and enhance the purchasing power of retirees, which is particularly important given the economic pressures from external factors such as tariffs[^1]. Additionally, the Bloc plans to implement a tax credit for experienced workers aged 65 and over to encourage continued participation in the labor force[^2]. They also propose various other measures, including incentives for seniors who wish to continue working and increased funding for programs that support seniors' quality of life[^3].
