The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, plans to implement targeted counter-tariffs against U.S. goods that Canada can either produce domestically or source from elsewhere. This strategy aims to minimize the impact on Canadian consumers while maximizing pressure on the U.S. economy[^1]. Additionally, the Conservatives propose removing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Canadian-made vehicles, a move intended to support the domestic auto industry amid U.S. tariffs[^2].
