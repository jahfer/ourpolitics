The Conservative Party of Canada in 2025 plans to maintain existing federal healthcare programs, including pharmacare and dental care, without committing to their expansion. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre emphasized protecting current services, contrasting with the NDP's push for expansion and the Liberals' cautious approach to future commitments[^1]. This stance reflects a broader strategy to ensure continuity for those currently benefiting from these programs, amidst criticism from the NDP regarding the party's previous votes against dental care and pharmacare bills[^2].
