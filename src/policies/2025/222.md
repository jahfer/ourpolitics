The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 aims to protect Canada's public healthcare system by banning American corporations from acquiring Canadian healthcare facilities[^1]. This policy is part of a broader strategy to safeguard healthcare from privatization and foreign trade pressures, particularly from U.S. influences[^2]. The NDP emphasizes enforcing the Canada Health Act and blocking trade deals that could compromise Canadian healthcare standards[^3]. Additionally, they plan to expand Medicare to include services like pharmacare and dental care, ensuring universal access to healthcare[^4].
