The Bloc Québécois proposes extending Quebec's secularism law, Bill 21, to federal employees working in Quebec, prohibiting them from wearing religious symbols in positions of authority and requiring federal services to be provided with faces uncovered[^1]. This proposal aims to align federal practices with Quebec's distinct identity and values, including modifying citizenship ceremonies to focus on Quebec's fundamental values and ensuring they are conducted in French[^2]. Additionally, the Bloc seeks to exclude Quebec from Canada's Multiculturalism Act, allowing the province to determine its own model for integrating newcomers[^3].
