The Liberal Party of Canada plans to enhance border security by training 1,000 new Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers to combat illegal guns, drugs like fentanyl, and smuggled cars. This initiative is part of a broader effort to strengthen border security and reduce the flow of illicit goods into Canada, particularly targeting organized crime and drug trafficking[^1]. Additionally, the Liberals propose to recruit 1,000 additional RCMP personnel to address drug and human trafficking, foreign interference, transnational repression, and cybercrime within Canada[^2]. These measures aim to bolster law enforcement capacity to tackle both traditional and emerging threats to national security and public safety[^3].
