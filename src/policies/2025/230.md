The Conservatives proposed removing capital gains taxes on reinvestments made in Canada from July 1, 2025, until the end of 2026. This policy aims to stimulate economic growth by encouraging domestic investment, particularly in industries such as homebuilding, small businesses, technology, and manufacturing. The estimated cost for this tax cut is $5 billion in 2025 and $5.5 billion in 2026.
