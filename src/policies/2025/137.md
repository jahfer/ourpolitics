The Conservative Party of Canada proposes eliminating the GST on new homes valued up to $1.3 million, aiming to save homebuyers up to $65,000 on average homes in major cities[^1]. This policy is projected to stimulate the construction of 36,000 additional homes annually, generating $2.52 billion in income tax revenue from construction workers[^2]. Funding for this tax cut will come from reallocating $8 billion from existing Liberal housing programs[^3].
