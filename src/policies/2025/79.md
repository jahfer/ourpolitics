The Liberal Party of Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, aims to strengthen Canada's trade and security alliances with France and the UK. This initiative involves diplomatic engagements and trade corridor development to diversify Canada's trade partnerships away from heavy reliance on the U.S., particularly in response to U.S. tariffs. Carney's visits to France and the UK emphasize deepening economic ties, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and clean energy[^1].
