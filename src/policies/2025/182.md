The Bloc Québécois in 2025 proposes several measures to support working seniors through tax credits and automatic tax returns. These measures include implementing a tax credit for experienced workers aged 65 and over to encourage continued labor force participation[^1], and introducing an automatic tax filing system for seniors to simplify their tax processes[^2]. Additionally, the Bloc plans to increase and automate the tax credit for home care, aiding seniors in aging in place[^3]. These policies are part of a broader suite aimed at enhancing seniors' financial stability and reducing administrative burdens.
