The Bloc Québécois aims to modernize copyright law to better protect creators' rights in the digital and AI era. They propose revising the concept of "fair dealing" to adapt to new technologies, ensuring creators are adequately compensated and protected. This initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance cultural autonomy for Quebec by redirecting funds from the digital services tax to support the cultural sector[^1][^2].
