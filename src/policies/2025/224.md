The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 announced a plan to retrofit 3.3 million homes with energy-saving upgrades[^1]. This initiative includes offering free retrofits to 2.3 million low-income households and providing grants or low-interest loans to 1 million more, potentially reducing energy bills by up to $4,500 annually[^2]. The program aims to support Canadian-made solutions and create thousands of union jobs in installation, auditing, and retrofitting[^3].
