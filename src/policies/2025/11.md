The Bloc Québécois is against the project, calling for it to be cancelled after the Kebaowek First Nation won a court case that showed the federal government did not properly consult them about it. The party states the project could be dangerous to the environment, especially the St. Lawrence River, and to people in Quebec and First Nations communities. They also mention that more than 140 towns and many experts are also against the plan.
