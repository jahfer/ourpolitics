The Bloc Québécois is calling for the cancellation of the Chalk River nuclear waste disposal project following a court victory by the Kebaowek First Nation, which highlighted the federal government's failure to properly consult Indigenous communities[^1][^2][^3]. The party emphasizes the project's potential environmental risks to the St. Lawrence River and the health of Quebecers and First Nations communities, noting opposition from over 140 municipalities and numerous experts[^2][^3]. This stance aligns with their broader environmental concerns and commitment to Indigenous rights.
