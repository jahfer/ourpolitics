The New Democratic Party (NDP) advocates for improving wages and working conditions for child care workers to increase the availability of affordable child care spaces. The NDP criticizes the Liberal government for not addressing issues such as wages, benefits, and pensions for child care workers, which they argue will lead to longer wait lists and higher costs for parents[^1]. Additionally, the NDP emphasizes that without these improvements, the $10-a-day child care programs could be at risk if other parties make cuts to these services[^2]. They assert that better conditions for child care workers are essential for creating more child care spaces and supporting families[^3].
