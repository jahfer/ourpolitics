The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, plans to repeal the Impact Assessment Act (Bill C-69) and the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act (Bill C-48), alongside opposing the Liberal government's clean fuel regulations[^1]. These actions aim to support the energy sector by eliminating regulatory barriers and fostering economic growth, particularly in energy exports[^2]. Critics argue these repeals could risk environmental impacts, while supporters highlight potential economic benefits, such as job creation and increased GDP[^3].
