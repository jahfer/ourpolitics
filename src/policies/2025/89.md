The Conservative Party aims to repeal key environmental laws, including the Impact Assessment Act (Bill C-69) and the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act (Bill C-48), and opposes clean fuel regulations, arguing these measures hinder energy development and economic growth.

They plan to replace Bill C-69 within a year to speed up project approvals, and repealing Bill C-48 would open up coastal access for oil tankers to support the resource industry and access overseas markets. The party views these policies as part of what they call "radical net-zero environmental extremism".
