The Liberals are removing the one-week waiting period for Employment Insurance benefits for workers impacted by U.S. tariffs as part of a support package to help with economic disruptions. This temporary measure ensures workers can get immediate financial help, allowing them to collect EI before they have used all their severance pay.

These changes to EI rules are meant to provide timely support for those facing job losses or reduced hours due to trade issues and are planned for quick implementation.
