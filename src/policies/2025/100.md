The Liberal Party of Canada has implemented a policy to waive the one-week waiting period for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for workers affected by U.S. tariffs. This measure is part of a broader tariff relief package aimed at providing immediate financial support to workers and companies impacted by trade conflicts with the United States[^1]. Additionally, the policy allows workers to collect EI benefits before exhausting severance pay and eases access to EI support during economic disruptions caused by tariffs[^2]. These actions are designed to mitigate the economic impact on workers facing job losses or reduced hours due to trade tensions[^3].
