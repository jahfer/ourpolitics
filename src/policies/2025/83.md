The Conservative Party of Canada plans to reinstate apprenticeship grants of up to $4,000 for apprentices in licensed trades as part of a broader strategy to strengthen the skilled trades sector. This initiative aims to train up to 350,000 tradespeople over five years, enhance financial support for apprenticeships, and facilitate the harmonization of health and safety regulations across provinces[^1]. The policy also includes expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP) to support training facilities and create a special class of rapid Employment Insurance (EI) payouts for pre-registered apprentices[^2]. These measures are designed to reduce Canada's reliance on foreign labor and boost domestic skilled labor[^3].
