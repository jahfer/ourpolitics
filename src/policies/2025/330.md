The Liberal Party plans to move forward with a program to buy back assault-style firearms, which they banned starting in 2020, adding over 2,500 varieties to a prohibited list. They aim to make the program faster and add more money to it, with the individual buyback program expected to start later in 2025.

As part of strengthening gun control, they also plan to change the law so the RCMP, instead of the gun industry, decides how new firearms are classified and automatically take away gun licenses from people found guilty of violent crimes, especially those involving intimate partner violence.
