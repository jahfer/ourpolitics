The Liberal Party of Canada in 2025 is focused on enhancing public safety through a comprehensive approach to firearm regulation. They plan to implement a buyback program for assault-style firearms, aiming to remove these weapons from communities to improve safety[^1]. Additionally, the party proposes transferring the responsibility for classifying new firearm models from the gun industry to the RCMP, ensuring impartial and expert oversight[^2]. To further strengthen gun control, the Liberals aim to automatically revoke gun licenses for individuals convicted of violent offenses, including intimate partner violence, addressing concerns about domestic violence and public safety[^3].
