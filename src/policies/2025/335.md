The Liberal Party of Canada in 2025 aims to address hate crimes by reclassifying hate-motivated murders, including gender-based killings of women, as first-degree murder. This policy seeks to ensure harsher penalties for such offenses, reflecting their severity. The move is part of a broader strategy to tackle violent crimes and hate-motivated offenses, as highlighted in various policy statements[^1][^2][^3].

In 2023, police services reported a 32% increase in hate crimes, reaching 4,777 incidents, with hate crimes targeting sexual orientation rising by 69%[^4]. These statistics underscore the urgency of the Liberal Party's proposed legal reforms to protect vulnerable communities and enhance public safety.
