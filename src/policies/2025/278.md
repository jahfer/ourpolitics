The Liberal Party of Canada is committed to reintroducing legislation to ensure clean drinking water for First Nations communities and to allocate funding for the protection of freshwater and wildlife. This policy is part of a broader effort to address long-standing issues in First Nations communities regarding access to clean water and to protect natural resources[^1][^2]. Additionally, the Liberals have pledged to increase funding to $40 million to facilitate engagement with Indigenous communities on energy projects, ensuring that consultations maintain environmental standards and Indigenous rights[^3]. Despite these commitments, the Liberal government has faced criticism for failing to eliminate boil-water advisories in Indigenous communities, despite significant funding allocated toward reconciliation efforts[^4].
