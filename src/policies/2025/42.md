The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has proposed a plan to bolster Canada's Arctic security by establishing a military base in Iqaluit capable of hosting F-35 fighter jets and P-8 surveillance aircraft. This initiative also includes the acquisition of two polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy and the expansion of the Canadian Rangers patrol group from 2,000 to 4,000 members, aimed at countering growing threats from China and Russia[^1][^2][^3].

The plan reflects concerns highlighted by CSIS about foreign adversaries exploiting the Arctic region, and it is part of a broader strategy to enhance Canada's military presence and sovereignty in the North[^4][^5]. Funding for these initiatives is proposed to be sourced by cutting foreign aid[^1].
