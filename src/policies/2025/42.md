The Conservative Party plans to build a military base in Iqaluit capable of hosting aircraft like F-35 jets and P-8 surveillance planes, buy two polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy, and double the size of the Canadian Rangers from 2,000 to 4,000 members to strengthen presence in the North. This plan is in response to growing threats from countries like China and Russia, with funding proposed by cutting foreign aid.
