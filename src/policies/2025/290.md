The Conservative Party of Canada plans to address housing affordability by selling 15% of the federal government's 37,000 buildings and converting them into affordable housing. This initiative aims to free up land for housing development and increase the supply of affordable units, as part of a broader strategy to tackle rising housing costs[^1]. Additionally, the Conservatives aim to hold cities accountable by requiring them to publicly disclose development charges and how federal reimbursements are used, ensuring transparency in the use of funds for housing projects[^2].
