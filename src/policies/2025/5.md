The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 advocates for implementing retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. to counteract tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and vehicles.

The NDP emphasizes the importance of reducing dependence on the U.S. by promoting Canadian products and increasing domestic production[^2].
