The Bloc Québécois has proposed ensuring that citizenship ceremonies in Quebec uphold the province's values by conducting them with faces uncovered. This policy emphasizes Quebec's secular and linguistic priorities, focusing on the province's fundamental values rather than the monarchy or religion, and mandates that ceremonies be administered in French[^1]. Additionally, the Bloc aims to extend Quebec's secularism law, Bill 21, to federal employees in Quebec, prohibiting religious symbols for federal employees in positions of authority and requiring federal services to be provided and received with faces uncovered[^2]. These measures reflect the Bloc's commitment to aligning federal practices with Quebec's distinct identity and secular values.
