The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, proposes to increase the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution limit by $5,000 annually, specifically for investments in Canadian companies, raising the total annual limit to $12,000[^1]. This policy aims to encourage domestic investment and strengthen the Canadian economy by promoting self-reliance and countering American economic influence[^2]. Critics argue that the policy may primarily benefit wealthier Canadians and introduce administrative complexities, while supporters believe it could boost domestic economic growth[^3].
