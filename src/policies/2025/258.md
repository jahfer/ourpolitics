The Conservative Party of Canada is committed to maintaining the retirement age at 65 for key programs such as Old Age Security (OAS), Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), and Canada Pension Plan (CPP). This policy aims to provide financial security and peace of mind for seniors, ensuring they can retire as planned without changes to the age threshold[^1]. Additionally, the Conservatives propose increasing the tax-free earnings threshold for seniors to $34,000, allowing them to keep Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) until age 73, and delaying the RRSP withdrawal age by two years to protect seniors' savings from market volatility[^2].
