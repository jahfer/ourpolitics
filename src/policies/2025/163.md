The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 has proposed a policy to ban corporate purchases of affordable rental housing. This policy aims to prevent large corporate landlords from acquiring existing affordable rental properties, which often leads to increased rents and evictions. The NDP plans to restrict sales of these properties to individuals, non-profits, municipalities, agencies, and co-ops[^1]. Additionally, the party intends to cut off federal financial support for corporate landlords who exploit tenants and boost the Rental Protection Fund to assist non-profits in purchasing affordable apartments[^2].
