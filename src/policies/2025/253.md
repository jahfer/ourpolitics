The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has proposed defunding the English-language services of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) while maintaining funding for its French-language counterpart, Radio-Canada. Poilievre argues that this move is part of a broader strategy to reduce government spending and avoid inflation, emphasizing that Radio-Canada's funding would be preserved due to its larger audience share in the French-language market[^1]. The policy includes a plan to eliminate government funding for the English CBC, suggesting that the private sector could fill the gap[^2].

The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, plans to defund the CBC's English-language services while maintaining funding for Radio-Canada, the French-language service. This policy aims to reduce government spending by eliminating government funding for the English CBC, with the expectation that the private sector will fill the gap. The current federal funding for CBC/Radio-Canada is $1.38 billion annually, and the Conservatives argue that defunding the English portion would save approximately $1 billion[^3].
