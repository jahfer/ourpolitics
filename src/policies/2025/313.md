The Conservative Party plans to establish a whistleblower incentive program and create a task force to close overseas tax havens. This initiative aims to recover up to $1 billion annually in lost tax revenue by targeting offshore tax evasion, which will be used to fund a $14-billion income tax cut by reducing the lowest tax bracket rate from 15% to 12.75%. The proposal includes redirecting CRA resources, expanding whistleblower rewards to 20% of recovered funds, and publishing a 'name and shame' list of tax-dodging corporations.
