The Conservative Party of Canada, in 2025, proposed tax policy changes aimed at providing greater tax fairness for traveling trades workers. They plan to amend the Income Tax Act to allow full deductions for food, transportation, and accommodation costs incurred by trades workers traveling more than 120 km for work[^1]. Additionally, they aim to end tax write-offs for luxury corporate jets, only allowing deductions equivalent to commercial flight costs[^2]. These measures are part of a broader strategy to support middle-class workers and ensure fairness in tax deductions[^3].
