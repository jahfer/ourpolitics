The Liberal Party of Canada plans to increase funding for the Canada Community Security Program, aiming to enhance security for groups vulnerable to hate crimes. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to address the rise in hate crimes, which saw a 32% increase from 2022 to 2023, with 4,777 incidents reported in 2023[^1]. Additionally, the party intends to introduce legislation to protect public spaces and individuals from hate-motivated offenses, reflecting their commitment to ensuring the safety of vulnerable communities[^2].
