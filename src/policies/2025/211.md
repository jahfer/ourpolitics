The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes to reduce the Employment Insurance (EI) qualification threshold to a universal 360-hour standard, aiming to make EI more accessible to a broader range of workers affected by economic uncertainties[^1]. This plan includes extending benefits to contractors and self-employed workers, part of the NDP's response to economic challenges such as Trump's trade war[^2]. The policy is designed to support workers during economic downturns and ensure they are not left without support during crises[^3].
