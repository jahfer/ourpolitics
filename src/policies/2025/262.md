The Bloc Québécois is committed to maintaining the digital services tax on tech giants to ensure these companies contribute fairly to Canada's public finances, despite potential U.S. tariff threats. This tax is seen as crucial for funding Quebec's cultural and media sectors and asserting economic sovereignty. The Bloc highlights the importance of sovereignty in taxing digital giants like Google and Amazon, which profit from local content and user data. They call on federal leaders to resist U.S. pressure, particularly from Donald Trump, who opposes such taxes[^1].
