The Conservative Party aims to boost Newfoundland and Labrador's economy by doubling oil and gas production and approving the LNG project, which is expected to generate an additional **$1 billion in revenue** and create **thousands of jobs**. This policy also seeks to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy by exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. The party criticizes the Liberal government for delays and cancellations of energy projects due to laws like C-69 and C-48, and opposes the Liberal cap on energy production, which they claim will cost jobs and economic growth.
