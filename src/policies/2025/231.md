The Conservative Party of Canada aims to double Newfoundland and Labrador's oil and gas production as part of their infrastructure policy[^1]. This initiative includes approving the LNG Newfoundland and Labrador project, which is expected to generate additional revenue and create thousands of jobs in the region[^2]. The party criticizes the Liberal government for delays in energy projects due to regulatory laws, advocating for the repeal of such laws to facilitate quicker approvals and enhance Canada's energy independence[^3].
