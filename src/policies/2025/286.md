The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 proposed ending tax agreements with known tax havens like Bermuda, aiming to close corporate tax avoidance loopholes and recover lost tax revenue. This policy is part of their broader focus on tax fairness and corporate accountability, with the party estimating that Canada loses tens of billions of dollars annually due to such practices[^1]. The NDP's approach contrasts with perceived inaction from other parties, emphasizing the need for transparency and fairness in the tax system[^2].
