The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 plans to enhance Employment Insurance (EI) by raising the maximum insurable earnings and increasing the EI benefit rate above 55% to ensure that benefits are sufficient to cover living expenses. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to protect Canadian workers from the economic impacts of external factors like Trump's trade war and tariffs[^1]. The NDP's approach also includes extending EI coverage duration and eliminating the one-week waiting period to provide immediate support to workers facing job insecurity[^2].
