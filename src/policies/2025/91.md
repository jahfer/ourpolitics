The Bloc Québécois advocates for immediate investment in infrastructure adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions reduction to combat climate change. They emphasize the high costs of inaction, noting that climate-related damages cost Canadians approximately $2 billion annually, with potential increases to $13.6 billion by 2100 if no measures are implemented[^1]. The party criticizes other parties for abandoning climate measures, arguing that such inaction benefits oil companies and banks at the expense of Québec's economy and households[^2].
