The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 focuses on maintaining the industrial carbon price and emissions cap as part of their climate policy. This approach is designed to ensure industries remain competitive while addressing climate change by making large polluters pay. The NDP proposes investing in building an East-West energy grid for electricity transmission and using 100% Canadian steel, which aims to create jobs and support Canadian workers[^2]. Additionally, the NDP plans to end the Consumer Carbon Tax, alleviating financial burdens on families and protecting workers during the transition to cleaner energy[^1].
