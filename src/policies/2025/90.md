The Conservative Party of Canada has pledged to re-establish a Ministry of Labour in response to Prime Minister Mark Carney's decision not to appoint a Minister of Labour. This commitment is part of a broader critique of Carney's background in investment banking and alleged anti-union activities at Brookfield Asset Management. The party, through its Shadow Minister for Labour Kyle Seeback, emphasizes the importance of this ministry in supporting workers and addressing labor issues[^1].
