The Liberal Party plans to exceed NATO's defence spending target of 2% of Canada's economy (GDP) before 2030, which is more than two years sooner than they planned before.

To do this, they plan to modernize military equipment, such as getting new submarines and icebreakers, add more people to the forces, and work with other countries to buy the next generation of aircraft. Canada currently spends about 1.37% of its GDP on defence, which is around $41 billion each year.
