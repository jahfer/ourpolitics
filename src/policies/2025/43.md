The Liberal Party of Canada has committed to increasing military spending to reach 2% of GDP by 2030, accelerating the timeline initially set by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau[^1].

The pledge includes modernizing military infrastructure and equipment, such as new submarines and icebreakers, to bolster national security[^3].
