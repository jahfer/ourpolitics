The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 proposed to enhance Employment Insurance (EI) benefits by eliminating the one-week waiting period and extending coverage to 50 weeks. This policy aims to provide immediate financial support and ensure workers are covered during prolonged economic challenges, particularly in response to external pressures such as U.S. tariffs[^1]. The NDP's plan also includes raising the EI benefit rate and reducing the qualification threshold to a universal 360-hour standard, making EI more accessible to a broader range of workers[^2]. These measures are part of a broader strategy to protect Canadian workers from economic downturns and ensure they receive adequate support during crises[^3].
