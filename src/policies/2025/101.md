The Liberal Party of Canada has implemented a policy to defer corporate income tax and GST/HST payments for businesses affected by tariffs, aiming to provide financial relief and improve liquidity. This measure is part of a broader tariff relief package designed to mitigate the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on key industries such as steel, aluminum, and agriculture[^1]. The deferral of tax payments is intended to support businesses in managing cash flow challenges during periods of economic instability[^2].
