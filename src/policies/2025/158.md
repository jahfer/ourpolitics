The New Democratic Party (NDP) has committed to doubling the Canada Disability Benefit, aiming to provide increased financial support for low-income individuals with disabilities. This policy is part of a broader $19 billion tax policy package designed to support vulnerable populations[^1]. The NDP plans to raise the Guaranteed Income Supplement to lift all seniors out of poverty and double the Canada Disability Benefit to $400 per month for eligible individuals[^2]. These measures are expected to cost between $3 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the party's focus on progressive taxation and support for working families[^3].
