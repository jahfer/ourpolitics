The NDP proposes increasing financial support for low-income individuals with disabilities to help them live with dignity, potentially raising benefits by up to **$2400/year**. While supporting the planned rollout of the Canada Disability Benefit in July 2025, the party criticizes its currently low amount, which is up to **$200/month** for eligible individuals. The cost of doubling this benefit, alongside increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors, is estimated to be **between $3 billion and $4 billion**.
