The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes to provide low-interest loans for first-time homebuyers through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to make homeownership more accessible. This initiative is part of a broader plan to address housing affordability, which includes building 3 million homes by 2030 and implementing stronger rent protections[^1]. The NDP emphasizes that these measures are designed to help working and middle-class families rather than benefiting banks and investors[^2].
