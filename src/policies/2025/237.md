The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has proposed capping immigration levels to align with the number of homes built in the previous year. This policy aims to ensure that population growth does not outpace housing availability, addressing concerns about the housing crisis. The party suggests reducing the annual intake of permanent residents to 200,000-250,000, similar to levels during the Harper era, and linking immigration numbers to housing construction[^1][^2][^3].
