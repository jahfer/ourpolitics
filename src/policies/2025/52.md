The New Democratic Party (NDP) of Canada has proposed canceling the contract to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets from the United States and instead prioritize building fighter jets domestically with Canadian companies[^1]. This policy is driven by concerns over national security and sovereignty, particularly the risk of the U.S. retaining control over software and hardware upgrades for the jets[^2]. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has emphasized the need to bolster Canada's domestic aerospace industry and reduce reliance on U.S. defense technology, with proposals to explore alternatives like the Swedish-made Saab Gripen jets[^3].
