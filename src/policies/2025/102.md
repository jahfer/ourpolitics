The Liberal Party of Canada supports the development of a high-speed rail line, known as Alto, connecting Toronto to Québec City, with stops in Peterborough, Ottawa, Montreal, Laval, and Trois-Rivières[^1]. The project, estimated to cost between $60 billion and $90 billion, aims to reduce travel time significantly and is considered the largest infrastructure project in Canadian history[^2]. The Liberal government under Prime Minister Mark Carney plans to fund the design phase with $3.9 billion over six years and intends to collaborate with private-sector partners[^3].
