The Liberal Party of Canada is considering potential changes to the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States in response to evolving geopolitical circumstances[^1]. While there are no immediate plans to reopen the agreement, the party acknowledges the need for adaptability due to changing U.S. policies and their potential impact on Canada's values, including human rights[^2]. Additionally, the Liberals propose a deal with other American countries to manage refugee settlement in a safe and controlled manner, addressing potential surges due to U.S. policies[^3].
