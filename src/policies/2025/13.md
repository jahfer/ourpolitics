The New Democratic Party (NDP) has proposed implementing emergency price caps on essential grocery items to address rising food costs, particularly in response to U.S. tariffs[^1]. This policy includes measures such as enforcing a mandatory Grocery Code of Conduct, empowering the Competition Bureau to monitor pricing, and taxing windfall profits of major retailers[^2]. These efforts aim to enhance affordability for Canadian families, especially as food prices have seen significant increases, like pasta up 43% and cooking oil up 75% since 2020[^3]. The NDP's approach is part of a broader strategy to ensure food security and combat corporate price gouging[^4].
