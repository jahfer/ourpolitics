The Liberal Party of Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, is reconsidering the purchase of 88 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, with a focus on reducing reliance on U.S. suppliers and exploring alternatives like the Saab Gripen that could be assembled in Canada[^1]. This review is prompted by escalating tensions with the United States and concerns over economic impacts, as well as the opportunity to enhance domestic production and job creation[^2]. The decision to potentially cancel a major portion of the order comes after already committing to the first 16 jets, with a total initial contract cost of $19 billion[^3].
