The Liberal government is reviewing Canada's plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets, initially costing about $19 billion. Citing concerns about high costs, dependency on the United States for support, and a desire for more Canadian economic benefits, the government is considering limiting the purchase to the first 16 jets already committed to and paid for, and exploring alternative aircraft from other countries like South Korea or Sweden, potentially allowing for assembly or maintenance in Canada.
