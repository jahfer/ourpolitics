The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, has stated that a Conservative government will not pass any laws restricting abortion, aligning with the party's long-standing policy since 2004[^1]. Poilievre has personally declared himself pro-choice, emphasizing his commitment to not changing abortion laws[^2]. However, the policy allows MPs to vote freely on issues of moral conscience, such as abortion, which could lead to challenges in safeguarding abortion rights if anti-abortion MPs are elected[^3].
