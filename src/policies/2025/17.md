The Bloc Québécois strongly opposes the federal government's funding of English promotion in Quebec, advocating instead for reallocating these funds to support the French language, francization, and French culture. Bloc spokesperson Mario Beaulieu criticized the federal government for spending over $200 million to promote English in Quebec from 2023 to 2024, arguing that these resources should be redirected to bolster French language initiatives[^1][^2]. The Bloc emphasizes that Quebec should be the sole architect of its language policy, exempting it from the Official Languages Act and ensuring the French Language Charter applies to federally regulated businesses[^3].
