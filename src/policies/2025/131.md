The Conservative Party aims to reduce government spending by making specific cuts beyond housing funds and foreign aid, including closing the Canadian Infrastructure Bank, reducing the size of the public service, and spending less on outside contractors.

They state these measures are intended to decrease government waste and inefficiency. The party also proposes implementing a "dollar-for-dollar law," requiring ministers to find a dollar in savings for every new dollar they spend, and plans to boost the economy through cutting regulations.
