The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, aims to reduce government waste and inefficiency by proposing significant spending cuts. Key measures include cutting the housing infrastructure fund, housing accelerator fund, defunding the CBC, closing the Canadian Infrastructure Bank, and reducing foreign aid. These actions are intended to decrease the size of the public service and its reliance on outside contractors, thereby addressing what Poilievre describes as a "broken" federal budget[^1].
