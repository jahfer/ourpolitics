The Bloc QuÉbÉcois is advocating for a comprehensive national aerospace policy that emphasizes long-term funding, effective partnership with Quebec, liquidity, and risk-sharing programs. They demand a share of defense contracts proportional to Quebec's significant contributions to the Canadian aerospace industry, which constitutes 53% of Canadian sales, 49% of jobs, and 75% of R&D[^1]. The Bloc criticizes Canada's current lack of a cohesive aerospace strategy and seeks to protect Quebec's aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and domestic policy challenges[^2].
