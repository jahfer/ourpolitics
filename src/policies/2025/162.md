The Bloc Québécois is advocating for a wage subsidy program to help businesses retain employees during economic crises, such as those caused by U.S. tariffs. This program is modeled after a similar initiative used during the pandemic and aims to prevent layoffs by allowing businesses experiencing a significant drop in revenue to maintain their workforce. The Bloc Québécois emphasizes the urgency of this measure, calling for immediate parliamentary action and proposing legislative changes to prioritize Quebec businesses in federal procurement contracts, among other protective measures[^1][^2].
