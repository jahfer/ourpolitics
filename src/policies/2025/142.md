The NDP would remove the GST on essentials such as grocery store meals, diapers and car seats, as well as monthly bills including cell, internet and home heating. Canadian-made vehicles would also be exempt from GST.

The party says a family of four would see $448 saved yearly, and is estimated to cost $4.5 billion/year.
