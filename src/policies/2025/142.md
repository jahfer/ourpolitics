The New Democratic Party (NDP) proposes to remove the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from Canadian-made cars and trucks, as well as essentials like internet and heating bills, to reduce the cost of living for families[^1]. This policy aims to save an average family of four approximately $448 annually while supporting domestic manufacturing[^2]. The NDP's broader tax relief plan targets lower-income Canadians and is estimated to cost $4.5 billion annually[^3].
