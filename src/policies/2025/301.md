The Liberal Party of Canada has introduced several measures in 2025 to enhance child protection online. They propose legislation to crack down on child-luring and increase penalties for distributing intimate images without consent, aiming to protect children from exploitation and sextortion[^1]. Additionally, they plan to provide new funding to the Canadian Centre for Child Protection to support its efforts in combating child exploitation[^2]. The party also intends to give law enforcement more time to prosecute sexual offenses against children, ensuring thorough investigation and prosecution[^3].
