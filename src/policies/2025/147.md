The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Mark Carney, is focused on diversifying Canada's trade relationships by strengthening ties with Asian countries, while explicitly excluding China due to concerns over environmental, gender, and labor standards, as well as strained diplomatic relations. Carney has emphasized the need to build deeper ties with like-minded countries in Asia, such as the European Union and the United Kingdom, as a strategic response to U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on any single trading partner[^1][^2]. This policy reflects a broader strategy to enhance Canada's economic resilience by diversifying its trade partnerships beyond North America.
