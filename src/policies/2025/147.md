The Liberal Party intends to deepen trade relationships with like-minded partners in Asia, explicitly excluding China due to concerns about environmental, gender, and labor standards, as well as strained diplomatic relations. This approach is part of a larger strategy to diversify trade away from the United States, involving cautious and deliberate engagement with China while prioritizing other partners in Asia and Europe. The party has also implemented tariffs on certain Chinese goods, including 100% on electric vehicles and 25% on steel and aluminum imports.
