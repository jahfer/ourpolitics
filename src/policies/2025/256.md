The Conservative Party of Canada plans to extend the age limit for contributing to Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) from 71 to 73. This policy aims to support seniors who choose to continue working by allowing their savings to grow for an additional two years, thus enhancing their financial security during retirement[^1]. By increasing the RRSP contribution age, the party intends to incentivize longer workforce participation among seniors and provide them with more flexibility in managing their retirement funds[^2]. This proposal is part of a broader strategy to reduce taxes on seniors' earnings and promote economic stability for retirees[^3].
