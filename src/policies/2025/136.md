The Conservative Party proposes cutting the lowest income tax bracket rate, aiming to save the average worker about $900 each year. For families with two incomes, this could mean saving up to $1,800 a year. This plan is expected to cost **$14 billion** annually once it is fully put in place and the party plans to pay for it by cutting government spending on things like bureaucracy and consultants.
