The Conservative Party of Canada plans to reduce the lowest income tax bracket from 15% to 12.75%, which would save the average Canadian worker approximately $900 annually[^1]. This tax cut is estimated to cost $14 billion annually when fully implemented by 2027-28[^2]. The party intends to fund this tax reduction by eliminating government waste, cutting federal bureaucracy, and reducing spending on consultants, foreign aid, and insider handouts[^3]. The proposal is part of a broader strategy to stimulate economic growth by increasing disposable income for Canadians[^4].
