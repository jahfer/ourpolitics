The Liberal Party of Canada's 2025 housing policy includes a significant financial commitment to boost affordable housing construction. Their plan involves creating Build Canada Homes (BCH) to provide $25 billion in debt financing and $1 billion in equity financing specifically for Canadian prefabricated home builders, aiming to double the annual home construction in Canada to nearly 500,000. This initiative is part of a broader strategy that also includes $10 billion in low-cost financing and grants for various affordable housing streams, reflecting the most comprehensive housing strategy since World War II[^1].
