The Liberal Party plans to create "Build Canada Homes (BCH)" to provide **$25 billion** in debt financing and **$1 billion** in equity financing for affordable housing projects, which includes funding for modular and prefabricated home builders. This program is part of a plan that aims to help double the number of homes built in Canada each year to almost **500,000**.
