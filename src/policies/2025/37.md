The Bloc Québécois supports the high-speed rail project connecting Toronto to Québec City, with stops in key cities such as Trois-Rivières, Montreal, and Laval[^1]. Bloc MPs René Villemure and Xavier Barsalou-Duval have expressed both support for this initiative and concerns about the project's timeline and cost management, noting that construction may not begin until 2030[^2]. The Bloc emphasizes the importance of transparency and cost control throughout the project's implementation[^3].
