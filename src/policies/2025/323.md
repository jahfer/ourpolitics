The Liberal Party of Canada aims to establish a "first and last mile fund" to support the construction of roads and infrastructure connecting new resource mines, focusing on critical minerals essential for electric vehicle batteries and non-emitting technologies[^1]. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to bolster Canada's industrial economy and enhance foreign trade opportunities. The fund is intended to facilitate the movement of energy and critical minerals across the country, thereby improving national trade efficiency and reducing dependence on external markets[^2].
