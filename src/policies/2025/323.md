The fund would provide support to build connections like roads and transmission networks from natural resource sites, particularly for critical minerals needed for clean energy, to existing supply chains like rail lines and highways. This is intended to help get critical minerals to market faster and is part of a plan to strengthen Canada's industrial economy and foreign trade opportunities. Specific details on the fund's dollar amount or whether it involves grants or loans were not provided.
