The Bloc QuÉbÉcois is committed to maintaining the digital services tax on major tech companies, such as Google and Amazon, despite potential threats of U.S. tariffs. This tax is crucial for ensuring these companies contribute fairly to Canada's public finances, particularly supporting Quebec's cultural and media sectors. The party emphasizes the importance of economic sovereignty and calls on federal leaders to resist pressure from the U.S., especially from figures like Donald Trump, who oppose such taxes[^1].
