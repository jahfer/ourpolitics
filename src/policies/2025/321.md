The Liberal Party of Canada plans to create a Major Federal Project Office to streamline and expedite the approval process for major resource projects, aiming to reduce review times from five years to two years[^1]. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to accelerate Canada's development as an "energy superpower" in both clean energy and oil and gas sectors, while maintaining environmental and Indigenous rights standards[^2]. The proposal includes consolidating various governmental processes into a "single window" system to facilitate quicker project approvals[^3].
