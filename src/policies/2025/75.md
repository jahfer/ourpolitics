The Bloc Québécois strongly opposes the reduction of the Translation Bureau's workforce, describing it as an affront to Quebecers and francophones in Canada[^1]. They argue that the cuts undermine the rights of francophone Canadians and compromise the quality of bilingual services[^2]. The Bloc emphasizes the importance of maintaining a robust workforce to support the French language and bilingualism in federal services, particularly in Quebec[^3].
