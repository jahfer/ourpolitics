The Bloc Québécois proposes to **abolish the tax on books**, a measure that has been in place in Quebec since the 1990s. This policy aims to preserve and promote Quebec culture by making books more affordable, thereby supporting local authors and readers. The Bloc emphasizes the importance of cultural preservation and accessibility, aligning with existing tax practices in Quebec[^1].
