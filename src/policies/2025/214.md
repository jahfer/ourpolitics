The NDP proposes a "massive" plan to build infrastructure like roads, bridges, transit, and health facilities using only Canadian materials such as steel and aluminum, creating unionized jobs. This includes improving infrastructure in northern Canada, and investing **$8 billion** through the Communities First Fund to help provinces build water, sewage, and transit needed for new housing. The plan aims to protect Canadian workers, stimulate the economy, and ensure public projects like high-speed rail use Canadian materials and are built publicly.
