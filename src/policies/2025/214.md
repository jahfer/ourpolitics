The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 plans to launch a "massive" infrastructure building initiative that prioritizes the use of Canadian materials and companies. This strategy aims to safeguard Canadian jobs and stimulate the economy by focusing on shovel-ready projects such as roads, bridges, transit, and health facilities, using Canadian steel and creating unionized jobs[^1]. Additionally, the NDP proposes investing $8 billion through the Communities First Fund to support provinces in building necessary infrastructure like water, sewage, and transit systems for new housing developments, provided they meet certain conditions such as implementing rent control and ending exclusionary zoning[^5].
