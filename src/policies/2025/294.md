The Bloc Québécois aims to make Quebec the sole authority over its linguistic policy by exempting it from the application of the Canadian Official Languages Act. This policy includes ensuring that the French Language Charter applies to federally regulated businesses and repatriating Quebec's share of funding from the Official Languages Action Plan. The Bloc argues that French is under threat in Quebec and Canada, and they seek to redirect federal funding to strengthen French language use, emphasizing that Quebec should be the primary architect of its language policy[^1].
