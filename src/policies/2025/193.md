The Bloc Québécois aims to expand the tax credit for Quebecers aged 60 and over to the rest of Canada, aiming to provide financial relief to seniors nationwide. This policy is part of a broader suite of measures to support seniors' financial stability, including increasing the home care tax credit and ensuring seniors can remain in their homes longer[^1]. The Bloc Québécois has consistently advocated for retirees' rights, addressing age-based discrimination and enhancing economic activity through increased purchasing power for vulnerable retirees[^2].
