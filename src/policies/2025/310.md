The Liberal Party of Canada plans to expand the RCMP and CBSA to combat smuggling and crime by hiring over 1,000 additional RCMP personnel and 1,000 new CBSA officers. This initiative aims to strengthen border security and law enforcement capabilities to tackle drug, gun, and car smuggling, as well as address threats like cybercrime and foreign interference[^1][^2]. Additionally, the Liberals propose training new officers to combat illegal guns, drugs, and smuggled cars, and enhancing forensic capabilities to track crime-related firearms[^3][^4].
