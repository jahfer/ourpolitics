The Liberal Party of Canada has pledged nearly $100 million in humanitarian relief and governance support for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank[^1]. This includes $30 million for recovery and governance in the West Bank, $45 million for healthcare, food, and shelter in Gaza, and $25 million for security programming, such as landmine-related initiatives[^1]. The funding comes as part of a broader effort to address the humanitarian crisis in the region, following a ceasefire in Gaza and amid international calls for increased humanitarian aid[^1].
