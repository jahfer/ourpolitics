The Liberal Party of Canada plans to address the 14,500 staff shortage in the Canadian Armed Forces by increasing pay and modernizing recruitment processes[^1]. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance military capabilities, including new submarines and heavy icebreakers, and improve service conditions like on-base housing and access to healthcare[^2]. The party aims to accelerate defense spending to meet NATO's target of 2% of GDP by 2030, highlighting a commitment to strengthening Canada's military presence and readiness[^3].
