The New Democratic Party (NDP) aims to address Canada's housing crisis by building over 100,000 rent-controlled homes on federal land by 2035. This initiative includes a $1 billion investment over five years to acquire more public land and the establishment of a Community Housing Bank to finance new construction[^1]. The plan emphasizes partnerships with non-profit developers, co-ops, and Indigenous communities, focusing on affordability and sustainability while respecting Indigenous rights[^2]. Additionally, the NDP proposes banning large corporations from purchasing affordable housing units to prevent corporate monopolization and ensure homes remain accessible to those in need[^3].
