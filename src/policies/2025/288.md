The Conservative Party proposes to require cities to boost home building by 15% annually. Cities that build more than the target could get bonus federal funding, while those that miss face stricter targets the next year and could have federal funding withheld. This policy is part of their plan called the "Building Homes Not Bureaucracy Act".
