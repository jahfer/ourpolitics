The NDP plans to hire **7,500** additional family doctors, which they estimate will cost **$10 billion** funded through increased federal transfers, expand care using teams of health professionals like nurses, and reduce paperwork for medical staff to free up time for patients.

The plan also involves training and keeping more doctors in northern and rural areas, making it easier for internationally trained doctors to work in Canada through streamlined processes like pan-Canadian licensure, and offering provinces an extra 1% in health funding if they guarantee access and report publicly on progress. This aims to address the fact that more than 6.5 million Canadians currently do not have access to primary care.
