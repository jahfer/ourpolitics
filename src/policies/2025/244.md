The New Democratic Party (NDP) is committed to ensuring that every Canadian has access to a family doctor by 2030. To achieve this, they plan to hire an additional 7,500 doctors, funded through increased federal transfers, and streamline the process for internationally trained doctors to practice in Canada[^1]. The NDP also proposes to expand primary care by supporting a team-based approach, including nurses and other health professionals, and provide incentives for provinces that guarantee access to family doctors[^2].
