The Conservative Party of Canada plans to eliminate tolls on the Confederation Bridge, aiming to reduce travel costs for Prince Edward Islanders and enhance interprovincial trade. This policy is expected to save residents and businesses over $50 per trip by covering the bridge's operating costs currently funded by tolls. The move is part of a broader effort to address affordability concerns and is criticized as an unfair burden on Islanders by the Liberal government[^1].
