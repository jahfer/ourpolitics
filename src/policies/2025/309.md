The Liberal Party of Canada in 2025 is implementing a policy to shift the burden of proof for bail in cases involving repeat offenders accused of serious crimes such as home invasions, violent car theft, or human trafficking[^1]. This policy requires these offenders to prove they deserve bail, aiming to enhance public safety by reducing recidivism. The approach builds on previous reforms by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and responds to rising crime rates, as highlighted by a 2023 Statistics Canada report showing a 2% increase in police-reported crime severity for the third consecutive year[^2].
