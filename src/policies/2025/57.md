The Liberal Party of Canada plans to invest $253 million in northern infrastructure, focusing on upgrading power plants, updating housing infrastructure, and funding a hydroelectric facility[^1]. This investment, announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney, aims to boost the North's economic potential and support reconciliation efforts with Indigenous communities[^2]. The funding includes specific allocations for power plant upgrades in Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Igloolik, and Iqaluit, as well as housing updates and the construction of new homes[^3].
