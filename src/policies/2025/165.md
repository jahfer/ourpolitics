The NDP plans to boost the Canada Rental Protection Fund with a proposed $1.47 billion over five years, starting in 2025-26, to assist non-profits in purchasing affordable apartment buildings[^1]. This initiative aims to address the affordability crisis by tackling the rapid loss of affordable rental units due to redevelopment and rent increases. Additionally, the party proposes tying federal housing funding to the introduction of rent controls by provinces and municipalities to ensure long-term affordability and prevent unfair evictions[^2].
