The Conservative Party of Canada plans to fund training halls to skill up 350,000 young workers over five years by expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP). This includes funding for building and operating programs, with up to 75% cost coverage for smaller unions, aiming to expand access to training facilities and ensure smaller unions can benefit from financial support[^1]. The initiative also involves reinstating apprenticeship grants of up to $4,000, which were previously canceled by the Liberal Party[^2]. Additionally, the plan includes working with provinces to harmonize health and safety regulations, allowing tradespeople to work across Canada without redundant retraining[^3].
