The Conservative Party plans to fund training halls for skilled trades by expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP), covering costs for building and running programs, with up to 75% cost coverage for smaller unions. They also propose creating a special class of rapid Employment Insurance (EI) payouts for pre-registered apprentices to support trainees. The goal is to train 350,000 tradespeople over five years, aiming to boost employment in the skilled trades and encourage more people to pursue these careers.
