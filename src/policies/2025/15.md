The New Democratic Party (NDP) supports the right to strike as essential for workers to secure better working conditions and fair wages. They have publicly opposed Bill 89 in Quebec, which restricts these rights. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has criticized this legislation as an attack on workers' rights, especially during economically challenging times due to potential U.S. tariffs[^1]. Additionally, the NDP has introduced federal anti-scab legislation to protect workers during labor disputes, emphasizing their commitment to standing up for workers' rights[^2].
