The Conservative Party plans to speed up approvals for major energy and resource projects like pipelines and power stations by issuing pre-approved permits and creating 'shovel-ready zones'. They would also establish a National Energy Corridor for pre-approved transport of critical infrastructure, and create a single office to handle approvals aiming for decisions within six months to a **maximum of one year**. This policy is intended to boost Canada's economic independence, create jobs, and reduce reliance on other nations for energy.
