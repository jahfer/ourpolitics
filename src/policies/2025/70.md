The Conservative Party of Canada in 2025 has proposed streamlining the approval process for major infrastructure projects, including power stations, LNG plants, and pipelines, by issuing pre-approved construction permits. This initiative aims to reduce bureaucratic delays and accelerate project timelines, thereby bolstering Canadaâ€™s economic independence and reducing reliance on the U.S. market[^1]. Part of this strategy includes creating "shovel-ready zones" with preapproved permits to facilitate rapid development[^6]. Additionally, the proposal involves establishing a 'rapid resource project office' to ensure applications are approved within a year[^7].
