The Bloc Québécois is advocating for policies that support artists in Quebec by allowing the spreading of income over several years for tax purposes and facilitating their access to employment insurance as seasonal workers. These measures aim to improve the socio-economic conditions of artists, recognizing the seasonal nature of their work[^1]. Additionally, the party proposes reallocating taxes from ticket sales into a fund dedicated to local cultural promoters, festivals, and small to medium-sized events to bolster the cultural sector[^2].
