The New Democratic Party (NDP) strongly supports ensuring access to safe, trauma-informed abortion care as a Charter Right, emphasizing reproductive rights as fundamental women's rights[^1]. On International Women's Day, the NDP highlighted the importance of protecting abortion access, positioning it as a critical issue in their 2025 campaign[^2]. The party's commitment to women's health and safety is part of a broader effort to maintain and expand public healthcare, including advocating for universal pharmacare and family doctor access[^3].
