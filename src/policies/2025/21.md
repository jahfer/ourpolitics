The Liberal Party of Canada, in 2025, is committed to doubling the pace of new housing construction over a decade[^1]. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to address the ongoing housing crisis in Canada by significantly increasing the supply of homes. Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney has outlined plans to accelerate home building, aiming to make housing more affordable for Canadians[^2]. The party's comprehensive approach includes a $6 billion investment in various affordable housing streams, such as supportive housing and shelters, and the creation of Build Canada Homes (BCH) to provide substantial debt and equity financing for housing projects[^3]. These measures are designed to double the number of homes built annually in Canada to nearly 500,000, with a focus on results and accountability[^4].
