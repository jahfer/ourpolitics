The Liberal Party plans to significantly increase home building. They propose creating a housing agency to oversee **$35 billion** in prefab and affordable home construction, and cutting red tape for builders. They plan to allocate **$4 billion** in grants and loans for affordable homes and **$6 billion** for deeply affordable housing and shelters.
