The Green Party of Canada is seeking an "electoral co-operation agreement" with the Liberals, NDP, and Bloc Québécois to prevent progressive vote splitting, which they believe could favor the Conservatives. The party is concerned about maintaining its national support, as it needs at least two percent of the national vote to continue existing as a party[^1]. They are open to exploring all options for this agreement to encourage Canadians to vote based on their preferences rather than strategic voting[^2].
