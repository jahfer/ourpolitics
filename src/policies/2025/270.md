The Bloc Québécois has proposed policies aimed at supporting small businesses by ensuring they benefit from equal postal rates and reduced credit card fees. Specifically, they advocate for obligating Postes Canada to offer the same postal tariffs to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as those available to larger companies with volume discounts. Additionally, they aim to mandate a reduction in interchange fees on credit cards by 0.5%, which would benefit local businesses and consumers by enhancing their purchasing power[^1].
