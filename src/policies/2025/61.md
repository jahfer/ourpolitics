The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 aims to expand Canada's trade relationships beyond the United States while emphasizing higher labor and environmental standards. This strategy is part of the NDP's broader plan to protect Canadian industries and workers from the impacts of U.S. tariffs and trade policies[^1]. As part of the "Workers for Canada" plan, the NDP proposes using Canadian-made products in infrastructure projects and implementing retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports to support affected workers and communities[^1][^3]. The party also advocates for policies that ensure Canadian jobs and industries are safeguarded from foreign exploitation and emphasizes the importance of building a self-reliant economy[^5][^9].
