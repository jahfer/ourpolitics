As part of their "Workers for Canada" plan, aimed at protecting Canadian jobs from U.S. trade actions, the NDP proposes expanding trade beyond the U.S. while raising labour and environmental standards. This includes exploring increased trade with Europe, balancing economic growth with environmental protection, using a Border Carbon Adjustment to help clean Canadian industries compete, and ensuring rights and environmental safeguards are protected in trade negotiations.
