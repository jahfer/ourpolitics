The Liberal Party of Canada has proposed a $2 billion Strategic Response Fund to bolster the Canadian auto sector against U.S. tariffs, focusing on enhancing competitiveness, job protection, and supply chain resilience[^1]. In response to U.S. tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles, the Liberals also plan to implement targeted counter-tariffs designed to maximize pressure on the U.S. economy while minimizing impacts on Canada[^2]. This strategy aims to support Canadian workers and industries, particularly in regions heavily reliant on the auto sector[^3].
