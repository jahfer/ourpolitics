The Liberal Party plans to establish a **$2 billion** Strategic Response Fund to help the Canadian auto sector and workers deal with U.S. tariffs, aiming to boost domestic production and create an 'All-in-Canada' supply chain for auto parts. They will also prioritize buying Canadian-built vehicles with government funds. In response to U.S. auto tariffs, they plan to implement counter-tariffs on American imports, with one proposal targeting **$35 billion** worth of U.S. vehicles.
