The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, plans to dismantle the federal framework for industrial carbon pricing and remove the emissions cap on the oil and gas sector. This move is intended to reduce costs for industries and consumers, contrasting with the Liberal Party's approach to maintaining and tightening carbon pricing systems[^1][^2]. Critics argue that eliminating these measures could hinder Canada's ability to meet its 2030 emissions reduction targets[^3].
