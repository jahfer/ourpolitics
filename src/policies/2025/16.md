The New Democratic Party (NDP) announced plans to build a new training centre for Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers in Windsor. This initiative aims to create jobs in Windsor while addressing gun violence by hiring thousands more border officers and expanding their mandate to patrol between ports of entry[^1]. The policy underscores the NDP's focus on enhancing public safety and economic development in the region.
