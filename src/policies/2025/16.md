The NDP plans to build a new training centre in Windsor for Canada Border Services Agency officers. This centre is intended to help stop illegal guns at the border, create jobs in Windsor, and address gun violence. The overall plan also involves hiring thousands more border officers and giving them more responsibilities, like patrolling between border crossings.
