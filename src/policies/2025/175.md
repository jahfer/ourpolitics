The Liberal Party of Canada announced a $5 billion Trade Diversification Corridor Fund to enhance trade-enabling infrastructure, including ports, railroads, inland terminals, airports, and highways. This initiative aims to reduce Canada's reliance on the U.S. market by diversifying trade partners and improving infrastructure[^1]. The fund is part of a broader strategy to protect Canadian workers and industries from U.S. tariffs, aiming to create jobs and build a more resilient economy[^2]. Additionally, the policy includes measures to strengthen port security to combat the trafficking of illegal goods[^3].
