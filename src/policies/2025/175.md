The Liberal Party plans to invest $5 billion in a Trade Diversification Corridor Fund to improve trade-enabling infrastructure like ports, railroads, inland terminals, airports, and highways. This fund aims to reduce Canada's economic reliance on the U.S. and diversify trade partners, in part as a response to U.S. tariffs. Strengthening port security is also part of this plan.
