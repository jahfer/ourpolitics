The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, supports Quebec's Bill 96, which restricts the use of English and other languages to promote French. Poilievre respects provincial autonomy, aligning with the Bloc Québécois by stating that the Conservatives would not contest the law in a Supreme Court challenge[^1]. This stance contrasts with the Liberal Party, which plans to support a legal challenge, citing concerns over Charter rights[^2].
