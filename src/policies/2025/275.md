The Liberal Party of Canada, under Mark Carney's leadership, aims to leverage public investment to stimulate private sector growth. This strategy involves ensuring that every dollar of government capital investment catalyzes multiple investments from the private sector. Carney emphasizes fiscal restraint, proposing to cap public service size and balance operational spending within three years to create room for economic investments[^1]. Additionally, the party plans to expedite approvals for large-scale projects to boost economic growth[^2].
