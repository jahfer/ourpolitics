The Bloc Québécois is advocating for the unconditional transfer of $1.2 billion in housing funds to Quebec municipalities, arguing that the federal government's conditions on these funds constitute interference in provincial jurisdiction. Bloc spokesperson Denis Trudel criticizes these conditions as causing delays during a housing crisis, emphasizing the need for Quebec to manage its housing policies independently[^1]. This stance aligns with their broader policy of advocating for Quebec's autonomy in housing matters, as highlighted in their various statements[^2].
