The NDP plans to introduce a Border Carbon Adjustment to prevent businesses in other countries with weaker environmental rules from having an unfair advantage over Canadian workers and industries. This measure is intended to help keep industries like steel and cement competitive, particularly as a way to protect Canadian industries and workers from the impacts of things like Trumpâ€™s trade war.
