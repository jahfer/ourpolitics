The Bloc Québécois has proposed abolishing the GST on second-hand goods sold in stores and on repair invoices. This policy aims to support the most vulnerable and promote environmental sustainability by encouraging a circular economy. By making second-hand goods more affordable, the Bloc hopes to help families in Quebec buy locally and preserve their purchasing power[^1].
