The Bloc Québécois has called for the Canadian government to impose sanctions against Rwandan officials in response to Rwanda's invasion of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They advocate for a ban on military exports to Rwanda to help stop the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis[^1][^2]. This stance is supported by Bloc Québécois foreign affairs spokesperson Stéphane Bergeron and human rights spokesperson Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe, who have criticized the Canadian government's inaction on the matter.
