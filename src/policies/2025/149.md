The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Pierre Poilievre, proposes to increase the annual contribution limit for Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) by $5,000, specifically for investments in Canadian companies. This policy aims to encourage domestic investment, promote economic growth, and reduce Canada's economic reliance on the United States[^1][^2]. Critics argue that it could primarily benefit wealthier Canadians and introduce administrative complexities, as the definition of "Canadian companies" remains unclear, especially for those with assets abroad[^3][^4]. Despite skepticism from financial advisers and economists regarding its impact on average Canadians, the policy is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the Canadian economy[^5].
