The Liberal Party of Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, announced a policy to increase the lifetime capital gains exemption limit to $1.25 million for small business shares and farming and fishing property[^1]. This move aims to support small businesses and encourage private investment, as part of a broader strategy to boost economic growth and job creation. The decision to cancel the proposed increase to the capital gains tax and maintain the current inclusion rate of 50% was made to counteract opposition from various groups, including the Conservative Party, which argued that the hike would negatively impact healthcare, home-building, and small businesses[^2].
