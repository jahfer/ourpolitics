The Bloc Québécois proposes replacing the daily prayer at the start of parliamentary proceedings with a moment of reflection, respecting freedom of conscience[^1]. This change aims to modernize parliamentary traditions to reflect Quebec's secular and independent values, moving away from religious and monarchical symbols[^2]. Additionally, the party suggests eliminating the oath of allegiance to the British Crown for elected officials, further aligning federal practices with Quebec's distinct identity[^3].
