The New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2025 is committed to protecting Canada's public healthcare system by banning U.S.-style private health care clinics and corporate takeovers of public services. This policy aims to ensure that healthcare remains accessible and publicly funded, opposing privatization efforts that could compromise the quality and availability of services for Canadians. The NDP emphasizes its track record of expanding Medicare, including introducing dental care and pharmacare, and contrasts its stance with the perceived privatization threats posed by other parties[^1][^2].
