The NDP plans to ban U.S.-style private healthcare clinics and corporate takeovers of public services to protect Canada's public healthcare system from privatization and foreign influence.

This includes banning American corporations from buying Canadian health care facilities, updating the Canada Health Act to stop corporations from billing patients directly for care, and ending the use of private nursing agencies, which they state cost $1.5 billion, to reinvest savings into public health care teams. They will also work to strengthen and enforce the Canada Health Act to prevent "Cash-for-Care" clinics that charge for basic services.
