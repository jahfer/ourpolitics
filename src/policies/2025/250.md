The Liberals plan to increase funding for CBC/Radio-Canada by $150 million annually. This funding boost aims to enhance the broadcaster's services, particularly in local news coverage and broadcasting emergency information.

The party also plans make parliamentary approval a requirement for any changes to CBC/Radio-Canada's funding. This contrasts with the Conservative Party's plan to defund the CBC's English-language services while maintaining funding for French-language Radio-Canada.

The <a href="https://site-cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/impact-and-accountability/finances/2024/annual-report-2023-2024.pdf" target="_blank">current federal operating funding</a> for CBC/Radio-Canada is approximately $1.34 billion/year with expenses around $1.8 billion/year.
