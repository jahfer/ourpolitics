The Liberal Party of Canada, led by Mark Carney, plans to increase funding for CBC/Radio-Canada by $150 million annually[^2]. This funding boost aims to enhance the broadcaster's services, particularly in local news coverage and emergency information dissemination[^3]. The Liberals also propose making CBC/Radio-Canada's funding statutory, requiring parliamentary approval for any changes[^4]. This contrasts with the Conservative Party's plan to defund the CBC's English-language services while maintaining funding for French-language Radio-Canada[^5].
