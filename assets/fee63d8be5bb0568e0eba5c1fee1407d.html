<h5 id="what-is-the-stock-option-tax-benefit">What is the Stock Option Tax Benefit?</h5>
<p>Companies typically reward employees and high-level executives with stock options as an alternative to higher salary or a bonus. Presently, only 50% of the profit from a stock option sale is taxable, which is identical to how capital gains are treated. Under the NDP plan, 100% of the profit would be taxable, which some see as unfair since capital gains would be given preferential tax treatment.</p>
