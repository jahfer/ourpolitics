<p>The NDP has proposed the creation of a <em>Parliamentary Science Officer</em>, who would be responsible for providing Parliament with scientific information and expert advice on scientific issues. </p>
<p>The difference between this plan and the Liberalsâ€™ <em>Chief Science Officer</em> is that the NDP proposal places the Officer under the power of Parliament, and cannot be appointed or removed by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The last news of this policy was at the end of 2014, and Mr. Mulcair has not spoken of the idea himself.</p>
