<p>The Liberals would replace the Universal Child Care Benefit with the <em>Canada Child Benefit</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>$533/month</strong> for families with children under the age of six</li>
<li>Up to <strong>$450/month</strong> to families with children under the age of 18</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the UCCB, the Canada Child Benefit would not be taxable, is matched with inflation, and would be weighted based on the income of the household. Families earning above $160,000 would not receive anything under the Canada Child Benefit.</p>
