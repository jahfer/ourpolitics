<p>The NDP plans to roll out a nation-wide childcare system, which will create <strong>one million</strong> spots for children, at a maximum cost of <strong>$15/day</strong>. All parents would be eligible to participate in the system.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacles are the cost, time and buy-in from the provinces. </p>
<ul>
<li>The estimated cost is around <strong>$5 billion</strong> annually, at peak</li>
<li>While they’ll begin opening childcare positions in 2015–16, they  won’t reach their goal of 1 million spots until <strong>2023</strong></li>
<li>Since the provinces are officially responsible for childcare, the NDP would need to work with provincial governments to get their plan off the ground</li>
</ul>
