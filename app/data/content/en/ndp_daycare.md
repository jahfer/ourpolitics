The NDP plans to roll out a nation-wide childcare system, which will create **one million** spots for children, at a maximum cost of **$15/day**. All parents would be eligible to participate in the system.

The biggest obstacles are the cost, time and buy-in from the provinces. 
- The estimated cost is around **$5 billion** annually, at peak
- While they’ll begin opening childcare positions in 2015–16, they  won’t reach their goal of 1 million spots until **2023**
- Since the provinces are officially responsible for childcare, the NDP would need to work with provincial governments to get their plan off the ground
