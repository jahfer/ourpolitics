The NDP has proposed the creation of a _Parliamentary Science Officer_, who would be responsible for providing Parliament with scientific information and expert advice on scientific issues. 

The difference between this plan and the Liberalsâ€™ _Chief Science Officer_ is that the NDP proposal places the Officer under the power of Parliament, and cannot be appointed or removed by the Prime Minister.

The last news of this policy was at the end of 2014, and Mr. Mulcair has not spoken of the idea himself.
