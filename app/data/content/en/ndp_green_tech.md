The NDP would invest **$200 million** across four years towards upgrading 50,000 homes and 15,000 apartments for energy efficiency. They have also promised **$150 million** over four years towards a “green municipal fund”. The fund would aid local governments in funding projects that promote sustainable living and transit.

The NDP would also look to purchase electric vehicles for the federal government and add 150 charging stations for electric-cars on federal land.
