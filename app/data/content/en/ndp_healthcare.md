The NDP intend to improve access and reduce the cost of prescription medication through bulk federal purchasing at lower-negotiated rates. By negotiating rates federally, the government would be able to secure low rates which will lower the cost of medication bought by provincial governments.

The NDP plan to invest **$2.6 billion** over four years to lower the cost of prescription drugs purchased by the provinces, and **$80 million** over four years towards the bulk-purchase plan itself. The plan is estimated to save provinces $3 billion/year.
