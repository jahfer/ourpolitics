The Liberals have promised to continue pension-splitting for seniors.

##### What is pension-splitting?
Pension-splitting allows individuals to have a smaller tax burden by splitting their pension income between their spouse and themselves. If one individual is earning much less than the other (through a pension or other means), their tax rate will be much more preferential than for the individual in the higher tax bracket.
