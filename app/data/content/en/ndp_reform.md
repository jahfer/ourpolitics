The NDP intends to implement a _mixed-member parliament_ (MMP) election format, whereby citizens are given **two votes**—one for their local candidate, and another for the party of their choice. After the local candidates are elected, the “party vote” determines how many extra seats that party is awarded nationally in the House of Commons, based on its share of popular vote.

This system is presently used in countries such as Germany, New Zealand and Scotland.
