The NDP have committed to repealing Bill C-51—the Conservative party’s anti-terror legislation—in its entirety. The NDP has raised concerns about the lack of parliamentary oversight in the bill and loose definition of “threats to national security”.

##### What is Bill C-51?
- Enables information sharing across 17 federal agencies without judicial barriers
- Allows police to detain terrorism suspects for 7 days without charge
- Lets the Minister of Public Safety add individuals to the no-fly list
- Enables CSIS to disrupt terror plots, protests, and websites interfering with the safety or economic stability of Canada
- Prohibits speech that promotes or glorifies terrorism
