The Liberals would replace the Universal Child Care Benefit with the _Canada Child Benefit_:

- Up to **$533/month** for families with children under the age of six
- Up to **$450/month** to families with children under the age of 18

Unlike the UCCB, the Canada Child Benefit would not be taxable, is matched with inflation, and would be weighted based on the income of the household. Families earning above $160,000 would not receive anything under the Canada Child Benefit.
