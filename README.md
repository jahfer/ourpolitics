# Our Politics

[Our Politics](https://ourpolitics.ca) started in 2015 with a single aim: making election platforms easier to understand.

Elections matter, but understanding headlines and press releases takes a lot of time. Our Politics aims to offer easy-to-read summaries of party platforms.

## Development

### Run Project

```sh
$ npm run serve
```

### Build for Production

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview
```

This will replace the development artifacts in `www/` for optimized versions. You can then deploy the contents of the `www/` directory.
