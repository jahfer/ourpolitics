Our Politics started in 2015 with a single aim: making election platforms easier to understand.

Elections matter, but understanding headlines and press releases takes a lot of time. Our Politics aims to offer easy-to-read summaries of party platforms.

The Our Politics platform collects major policies from Canadian federal political parties, providing references, reader-friendly summaries, and analyses by topic.
